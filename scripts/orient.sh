# ── ORIENT: the loop looks at itself, and derives what to do next.
#
# **This is the first action of every tick, and it replaces remembering.**
#
# For eighty-two ticks the answer to *"what next?"* came from a document — the pattern ledger, the roadmap,
# the last journal entry. Those documents were **wrong six times**, and wrong about their own top priority
# twice. Ten ticks were spent on 9% of the ground that was already checked out, because nobody re-derived
# the picture; they inherited it.
#
# > **A plan is a memory. A measurement is a fact.** This script throws the memory away every tick and
# > rebuilds the picture from the tree: what is broken, what is biggest, what is at risk.
#
# It prints four things, in the order the loop must consider them:
#
#   1. **BAR 0** — anything crashing or hanging. Outranks every other consideration, always.
#   2. **THE RATCHET** — anything that would regress. A tick that trades is not allowed to land.
#   3. **THE WORK LIST** — every WPT area, ranked, and the *failure-message histogram* of the largest.
#      The top row of that histogram IS the next tick, if it is a mechanism.
#   4. **HEALTH** — the wall, the perf floors, duplicate downloads, compiler warnings. A browser that
#      passes tests while getting slower and fatter is not becoming a browser.
#
#   scripts/orient.sh              # full: re-sweeps WPT (slow, honest — do this for a capability tick)
#   scripts/orient.sh --cached     # reuse the last sweep (fast — for a second look inside one tick)

cat <<'RULE'

  THE RULE (docs/loop/GRIND.md):
    Take the top row that is a MECHANISM, not an instance. "Reflection" is a tick;
    "fix input.disabled" is four hundred ticks. Prefer a mechanism that also serves the
    NEAR horizon (a real page calls it) — that is where the cheapest tick lives.
    Keep going broad while any mechanism is worth >= 500 subtests, ANYWHERE.
    A stub is worse than an absence: if it cannot be done properly, skip it and SAY SO.
RULE

# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The OTHER horizon. WPT is the scoreboard; this is the goal. They are nearly orthogonal (measured, tick
# 70), so a loop that reads only one of them optimises blind — which is how ten ticks went into the wrong
# room. Both, in the same breath, every tick.

  ── THE VERDICT — how this tick is chosen, mechanically:

     1. Is anything CRASHING or HANGING?              → that is the tick. Bar 0 outranks every score.
     2. Is the largest INVISIBLE area bigger than the → OPEN THE APERTURE. wpt-expand.sh, then re-map.
        largest mechanism inside the visible ones?       An area you cannot see cannot be ranked.
     3. Is a constellation class further behind than  → probe its UNKNOWNs (? outranks ✗), then fix its
        the WPT work list?                               biggest hole. WPT is the scoreboard, not the goal.
     4. Otherwise                                     → the top MECHANISM in the failure histogram.

     Then: probe first · implement · gate · falsify · the wall · tick.sh. Go to 1.
     Never ask. A question to the user is a tick that did not happen.
