# BOX LAYOUT — taffy mapping realities and quirks (flex / grid / sizing)

Manuk's flex and grid layout runs on a vendored **taffy 0.12** tree (`engine/layout/src/taffy_tree.rs`,
`flex.rs`). Block / inline / float / table nodes are Manuk-measured *leaves* of that tree; taffy only
lays out the flex/grid containers and their directly-nested flex/grid descendants. The mapping from
Manuk's `ComputedStyle` to `taffy::Style` (`to_taffy_style`) is where the realities below live.

## A mixed `calc()` must NOT collapse to one term — taffy has calc plumbing; wire it (tick 139)

`Dim::Calc { px, pct }` is Manuk's reduced linear form of a `calc()`: the used length is
`px + pct% · basis` (percentages stored 0–100). The **block** path resolves it correctly everywhere via
`Dim::resolve(reference, _)`. The **taffy** path did not: `dimension()`/`lp()`/`lp_auto()` mapped a
`Dim::Calc` to `length(px)` when `px != 0` **else** `percent(pct)` — i.e. it kept **one term and threw
the other away**. So `width: calc(100% − 250px)` (`px = −250, pct = 100`) became `length(−250)`, which a
flex item clamps to **0**. Every fixed-gutter sidebar split — `calc(100% − <rail>)` main, `calc(<fixed> +
100%)` panel — collapsed to nothing on a flex/grid parent while rendering fine on a block parent.

**The fix is not a hand-rolled resolver — taffy already has one.** taffy's `Dimension` /
`LengthPercentage` / `LengthPercentageAuto` each have a `::calc(ptr: *const ())` constructor (behind the
`calc` feature, which is in taffy's default set). `ptr` is an **opaque handle** taffy never dereferences;
it hands the handle back to `LayoutPartialTree::resolve_calc_value(&self, ptr, basis) -> f32` with the
definite basis at layout time, and expects the resolved px.

**The encoding (why it is an index, not an address).** `CompactLength::calc` asserts the handle is
**non-null and 8-byte aligned** (low 3 bits = 0) and round-trips it verbatim (the calc tag is `0b000`, so
no bits are stolen). We keep a `calc: Vec<(f32, f32)>` on the `TaffyDom` and encode the *index* as
`((idx + 1) << 3) as *const ()` — 8-aligned, non-null (the `+1` keeps index 0 off null), and an index
rather than a pointer into the `Vec`, so the `Vec` may reallocate freely without invalidating any live
handle. `resolve_calc_value` decodes `(ptr >> 3) − 1`, looks up `(px, pct)`, and returns `px + basis · pct
/ 100` — the *same* linear form the block path uses, so flex/grid items and block items now agree.

Only a **genuinely mixed** calc (both terms non-zero) needs the handle; a single-term calc still takes
taffy's `length`/`percent` fast path (no table entry). Gate: falsifiable unit test
`flex_item_calc_width_mixes_px_and_percent` + full-pipeline `flex_sidebar_calc_width_resolves_in_full_pipeline`
(a `calc(100% − 250px)` sidebar in a 1000px flex row must be 750px; the old collapse made it 0, and
reverting the wiring makes both tests go red).

**Bound.** Grid *track* sizing (`track_min`/`track_max`) still maps calc via the collapse — `calc()` in a
`grid-template-columns` track is rarer and is a follow-on. Sizes, min/max, inset, margin, padding and
flex-basis all resolve calc correctly.

## Why the WPT calc suites barely move on a layout-calc fix

`css/css-values`'s ~85 `calc(...)` tests are overwhelmingly **serialization / computed-value** tests
(`getComputedStyle` returns the calc expression) — a *cascade* axis, not a *layout* one — so a taffy-path
fix does not touch them. The `css/css-sizing` and `css/css-flexbox` calc tests that DO measure layout are
mostly **reftests** (Bar-2, skipped) or additionally depend on **intrinsic sizing** (min/max-content
propagation, still open). A layout-calc fix is therefore a *daily-driver render* win with a near-zero WPT
flip — gate it with a falsifiable layout assertion, not a subtest count.

## Absolute box with both insets set is a DEFINITE size — lay its children out with it (tick 144)

An `absolute`/`fixed` box with both block insets set (`top` and `bottom`, i.e. the `inset:0` fill pattern)
has a **definite** used height via the constraint equation — *containing-block height − top − bottom −
frame* (CSS2 §10.6.4) — even when `height:auto`. Manuk's abspos layout computed that height correctly for
the box itself, but did so **after** laying out the children (`layout_children(..., None, ...)`), so a
`height:100%` child was resolved against an *indefinite* base and **collapsed to 0**. On the real web that
is the overlay / modal / backdrop: `position:absolute; inset:0` to fill a positioned ancestor, with a
`height:100%` inner layer that then measures 0 and vanishes.

**Fix (`layout_abs`, `engine/layout/src/lib.rs`).** Compute the definite content height *before* the
children in the two cases where it is knowable without them — an explicit non-`auto` height, and
`height:auto` with both insets set (the constraint equation) — and thread it down as the percentage base
(`pch`). The content-sized case (auto height, not both insets) keeps `pch = None`, which is correct: a `%`
height there is `auto`. The post-children height computation is unchanged (a non-`auto` `Dim` ignores its
`auto_px` fallback, so this equals the old `other.resolve(cb.height, ch)`), so box heights do not move —
only percentage-height *children* of definite abspos boxes gain a real base.

**WPT / gate.** `css/css-sizing` +2 (`abspos-intrinsic-height-inset-percentage-child`'s `height:auto` and
`height:stretch` cases; the `fit/min/max-content` cases stay failing — those need real intrinsic-keyword
`Dim` variants, still `Dim::Auto` today). Gated by the falsifiable layout unit test
`abspos_inset_zero_gives_percentage_height_child_a_definite_base` — RED (child = 0) when the base is
withheld, GREEN (child = 200) with it. **Note:** the test cascade `MinimalCascade` parses the
`top/right/bottom/left` longhands but *not* the `inset` shorthand, so the unit test uses the longhands; the
full stylo pipeline (what the WPT run and real pages use) parses `inset:0` too.

## The CSS `aspect-ratio` property was never mapped from the cascade (tick 145)

`ComputedStyle.aspect_ratio` (a plain `width/height` f32) was set in exactly one place — the page layer,
from a **decoded image's** intrinsic pixels (`engine/page/src/lib.rs`). The **CSS `aspect-ratio`
property** had no arm in `stylo_map.rs`, so `aspect-ratio: 16/9` on a `<div>` reached layout as `None`.
The transfer machinery already existed and was correct — the in-flow block path derives an auto width
from a definite height (`layout/src/lib.rs` §1372) and an auto height from the width (§1459) — it just
**never had a value to transfer**. A first attempt that added an abspos transfer moved the WPT count by
zero and named the real bug: *the mechanism existed; the value never reached it* (the metric-won't-move →
suspect-the-metric lesson).

**Fix (three parts).**
1. `stylo_map.rs` maps stylo's computed `AspectRatio { auto, ratio: PreferredRatio<NonNegativeNumber> }`
   onto `s.aspect_ratio = w/h` whenever a `<ratio>` is present (the `auto` keyword is dropped — for a
   non-replaced box the specified ratio always applies).
2. The hand parser `MinimalCascade` (`engine/css/src/lib.rs`) learns `aspect-ratio` at parity: `w/h`, a
   bare number (`n/1`), and `auto <ratio>`. This keeps the two cascade paths in step and lets the layout
   tests drive real CSS instead of injecting the field.
3. `layout_abs` gains a **box-sizing-aware** aspect-ratio transfer for its auto width (scale the definite
   height in the box the ratio names — `ch + bs_extra_h` — then convert back to content, `- bs_extra_w`;
   both deltas 0 under content-box) and, a pre-existing gap, now honours `box-sizing:border-box` for its
   own explicit `width`/`height`.

**WPT / gate.** `css/css-sizing` 229→240 (+11), all from the mapping (the in-flow transfer, live at
last); css-flexbox/grid/position/overflow flat. Gated by `aspect_ratio_parses_to_a_width_over_height_ratio`
(css) and the end-to-end `abspos_aspect_ratio_transfers_definite_height_to_auto_width` (layout, RED when
the transfer arm is neutralised). **Residue:** `abspos-aspect-ratio-border.html` still fails — those boxes
set no insets, and a static-position abspos box records no geometry, so `offsetWidth` reads 0 regardless
of the ratio. That is a separate mechanism (static-position abspos placement), not an aspect-ratio bug.

## An intrinsic-keyword `height` is INDEFINITE — not the same as `auto` (tick 146)

`size_to_dim` (`stylo_map.rs`) collapses **every** non-length `Size` to `Dim::Auto`: `auto`, `stretch`,
`fill-available`, *and* the intrinsic keywords `min-content`/`max-content`/`fit-content`. That is fine for
length *resolution* (they all lack a length), but it erases a distinction layout needs. Tick 144 taught
`layout_abs` that an `auto` height with **both** insets set is **definite** (CSS2 §10.6.4 constraint
equation: `CB − top − bottom`) so a `height:100%` child gets a real base. But an **intrinsic-keyword**
height is **indefinite** (CSS Sizing 3 §cyclic-percentage-contribution): the box sizes to content and the
`%`-height child sees an indefinite base → auto. Collapsed to `Dim::Auto`, `height:fit-content` looked
exactly like `auto`, so an `inset:0; height:fit-content` popover **stretched to the containing block
(200)** instead of hugging its content (80). The `top-only` case already did the right thing — only the
both-insets definite path over-reached.

**Fix.** A new `ComputedStyle::height_intrinsic: bool`, set true for `min`/`max`/`fit-content` (and
`fit-content(...)`) — NOT for `auto`/`stretch`/`fill-available`, which stay definite. Set in `stylo_map`
(`size_is_intrinsic`, matching the `GenericSize` keyword variants) and in the hand parser at parity.
`layout_abs`'s `definite_ch` gains one arm — `Dim::Auto if s.height_intrinsic => None` — so the box falls
to the existing content-sizing path. In-flow layout is deliberately untouched: a block's `auto` and
intrinsic-keyword heights both size to content there, so the collapse stays correct; only the abspos
both-insets path changes.

**WPT / gate.** `css/css-sizing` 240→243 (+3, the fit/max/min-content subtests of
`abspos-intrinsic-height-inset-percentage-child.html`); css-flexbox/grid flat. Gated by
`intrinsic_height_keywords_flag_the_box_as_indefinite` (css) and
`abspos_intrinsic_height_with_inset_zero_sizes_to_content_not_stretch` (layout) — the latter also asserts
`auto`/`stretch` **still** stretch to 200, locking tick 144's behaviour in as a regression guard. Proven
RED by neutralising the guard arm. **Note:** the unit cascade parses the inset *longhands* but not the
`inset` shorthand (a tick-144 note), so the layout test drives `top/right/bottom/left:0`; the WPT run uses
stylo, which parses `inset:0`.

## A `position:relative` percentage `top`/`bottom` resolves against the containing-block HEIGHT (tick 147)

`layout_block`'s `position:relative` offset resolved the horizontal delta against `cw` (the containing
block width — correct) but the **vertical** delta against a hardcoded `0.0`. The comment rationalised it
(*"height unknown here"*), but the height is **not** unknown: `pch: Option<f32>` — the definite content
height already threaded down for percentage *sizing* (`height:50%`, `min/max-height`; tick 144) — is
exactly the containing-block height a `%` inset resolves against. So `top:50%` on a relative box computed
`50% of 0 = 0` and the box **never moved vertically**; every percentage-nudge / vertical-centering relative
idiom silently sat at its flow position.

**Fix.** `let cb_h = pch.unwrap_or(0.0);` and resolve the vertical delta (`top`/`bottom`, and their calc/
percent forms) against it. `pch == None` (indefinite CB) still yields 0 — which is the spec's "computes to
auto" for `top`/`bottom` percentages against an auto-height containing block, so nothing regresses. The
containing block only threads a definite `pch` when it has one — an abspos box with a definite `height`
(the position-relative-016 cases), or any block with an explicit/resolved height.

**WPT / gate.** `css/css-position` 69→75 (+6, the definite-CB subtests of `position-relative-016.html`;
the inline / auto-height-ancestor cases t6–t9 still fail — they don't thread `pch`, a separate mechanism).
Bonus `css/css-flexbox` 949→953 (+4, relative flex items). css-sizing/grid/transforms flat. Gated by
`relative_percentage_top_resolves_against_containing_block_height` (layout), which measures the shift as a
*delta* vs `top:0` (isolating it from the box origin) and is proven RED by reverting `cb_h` to `0.0`.

## Percentage heights resolve against the initial containing block, and `max-height:%` on an indefinite parent is `none` (tick 150)

Two percentage-height bugs, one theme — a `%` height reference that was silently **0**.

**1. The full-height app-shell chain never filled the window.** `layout_document` seeds the root box
(`body`, or `html` if no body) with `pch: None`. But the initial containing block has the **viewport's**
dimensions (CSS2 §10.1), and its height is the reference a root-level `height: 100%` resolves against — the
`html,body{height:100%}` → `#app{height:100%}` chain every SPA uses to make a scroll pane fill the window.
With `None`, that root percentage was indefinite, so the whole chain fell back to *content* height: the
pane collapsed to its content and a `100vh` sibling (resolved at **parse** time against the same viewport)
filled the window while the `height:100%` box next to it did not — a visible inconsistency between two
spellings of the same intent. **Fix:** seed the root with `Some(manuk_css::values::viewport_size().1)` —
the *same* viewport `vh` resolves against, so the two can never disagree. Only elements with an explicit
percentage/definite height up the chain change; an `auto`-height body still yields `None` to its children,
so content-sized pages are untouched.

**2. `max-height:%` against an auto-height parent clamped the box to 0.** `max_h` resolved the percentage
against `pch.unwrap_or(0.0)`, so an indefinite containing block gave `max-height: 100%` → `0` and the box
vanished. Per CSS2 §10.7 a percentage `max-height` against an indefinite CB height is treated as **`none`**
(no cap). **Fix:** `Dim::Percent(_) if pch.is_none() => f32::INFINITY` (and the `Calc{pct != 0}` form).
This is the ubiquitous `img { max-width:100%; max-height:100% }` responsive reset — previously every such
image collapsed to nothing inside an auto-height parent. (`min-height:%` against an indefinite CB is `0`,
which `unwrap_or(0.0)` already produced — no change needed there.)

**WPT / gate.** `css/CSS2/normal-flow` 17→18 (the `height:30000px; max-height:100%` case). The app-shell
chain is mostly reftest-covered (Bar 2, deferred), so it is gated by unit tests instead:
`root_percentage_height_fills_the_viewport` (asserts `#app` height == the viewport height through the root)
and `percentage_max_height_indefinite_parent_is_none` (asserts a `height:500px; max-height:100%` box stays
500 inside an auto-height parent). Both proven RED by reverting the respective change. flex/position/
overflow/sizing flat, HANG/CRASH 0.

## Parent↔child margin collapsing (tick 151)

The last unmodeled piece of CSS2 §8.3.1: for ~150 ticks `layout_block` collapsed **adjacent-sibling**
margins (`collapse_margins`) but left a documented gap — a parent's margin did not collapse with its
first/last in-flow **block child's**. That left the child's margin sitting *inside* the parent as a
spurious gap: the classic `<div class=card><h2>…</h2></div>` where the h2's top margin opened a band of
card-background above the heading, and the symmetric bottom case where the parent's height double-counted
the last child's trailing margin.

**When it applies.** A block collapses its top (resp. bottom) margin with its first (resp. last) in-flow
block child when the box is a plain `display:block`, `overflow:visible`, establishes no BFC, and has **no
border and no padding on that edge** (`top_margin_collapses` / `bottom_margin_collapses`). Bottom
additionally requires **auto height** — a definite height fixes the content box, so the margin cannot
escape. Clearance on the first child, or a leading/trailing out-of-flow (float/abs) child, declines the
collapse (conservative: never wrong, occasionally incomplete). `overflow:hidden`/`auto`/`scroll` — the
card/clearfix margin-containing idiom — deliberately does **not** collapse.

**Top — hoist upward.** A cheap left-spine peek `collapse_through_top(node)` computes the first in-flow
block child's *collapse-through* top margin (its own top margin joined recursively with ITS first block
child's, down the spine — the h2-margin has to travel up through however many border/padding-less wrappers
sit between it and the card). `layout_block` folds that into the box's own top margin (`effective_mt`),
which both raises the box's border-top and is reported as `margin_top` so a grandparent collapses against
the already-collapsed value. `layout_children` recomputes the identical hoist and places the first block
`hoist_top` higher, landing it flush at the content top. Using the *same* peek on both sides makes the
child land exactly at `content_y` regardless of the peek's precision.

**Bottom — escape downward.** `collapse_through_bottom` walks the right spine symmetrically. When the box
is bottom-eligible and auto-height, that trailing margin is **subtracted from content height** (undoing the
old "the last in-flow block's trailing margin still occupies the container" line) and collapsed into the
box's own `margin_bottom` (`effective_mb`), so it escapes below the border-bottom instead of padding the
parent from the inside.

**Approximation (documented).** The spine walks resolve percentage *vertical* margins against an
approximate width (the top box's containing-block width, not each level's own content width). px/em
margins — width-independent and the overwhelming norm — are exact; only a percentage vertical margin deep
in the spine drifts, and only in where the collapsed margin lands, never in whether the collapse fires.

**Gate.** Four unit tests, the two collapse ones proven RED by disabling the eligibility helpers:
`parent_child_top_margin_collapses` and `parent_child_bottom_margin_collapses` (child flush / no internal
gap), plus the eligibility guards `overflow_hidden_contains_child_margin` and
`top_border_blocks_margin_collapse` (which correctly stay green when collapse is off — they assert
*non*-collapse). The visible wins are mostly Bar-2 reftests (deferred); the testharness sweep held or
nudged up — css-flexbox 26.5→26.6%, css-sizing 14.5→14.8%, css-position/overflow/normal-flow flat,
**HANG/CRASH 0**. Nothing regressed, which is the bar for a mechanism this broad.

## `overflow` establishes a block formatting context — float containment / the clearfix (tick 152)

`establishes_bfc` had listed float/abspos/flex/grid/inline-block but **not `overflow`** ("overflow is
not modeled yet"). So `overflow:hidden`/`auto`/`scroll` — the single most common float-containment idiom
on the web — did nothing structural: a container's floated children escaped it (the box stayed as tall
as its own non-float content) and the box's content still wrapped around *outer* floats. A probe made it
concrete: `<div style="overflow:hidden"><div style="float:left;height:60px"></div>text</div>` came out
**18px** tall (one text line) — the 60px float escaped.

**Fix.** One clause: `s.overflow != Overflow::Visible` establishes a BFC (CSS2 §9.4.1 / Display §2.1).
Any non-`visible` value (hidden/auto/scroll/clip — Chrome establishes a BFC for `clip` too) then routes
through the existing BFC branch in `layout_block`: the box gets its own `FloatContext`, its floats stay
inside, its content does not overlap outer floats, and it grows to contain its floats via
`own_bfc.lowest_bottom()` (CSS2 §10.6.7 auto-height). This is the modern clearfix and the reason
`overflow:hidden` on a card/row makes it wrap its floated media.

**Interaction with margin collapse (tick 151).** A BFC does not collapse margins with its children, and
`top_margin_collapses`/`bottom_margin_collapses` already gate on `overflow == Visible` *and*
`!establishes_bfc` — so `overflow:hidden` correctly both contains floats AND contains child margins, with
no double-handling. The `overflow_hidden_contains_child_margin` guard (t151) still holds.

**Gate.** `overflow_hidden_contains_floats` (parent height >= the 60px float), proven RED by the 18px
probe. Sweep: css-flexbox 26.6%, css-position 28.8%, css-overflow 27.8%, css-sizing 14.8%,
CSS2/normal-flow 15.4%, CSS2/floats 60% — all flat, **HANG/CRASH 0**. overflow:hidden is pervasive, so
flat-with-no-crash across the layout suites plus the full wall (parity + oracle fidelity) is the bar.

## An intrinsic-keyword `width` HUGS its content — not the same as `auto` (which fills) (tick 153)

**Symptom.** `width:fit-content` on a block filled the containing block (a probe: `<div width:fit-content>fit</div>`
in a 300px parent came out **300px** where Chrome hugs at ~14px). `width:max-content`/`min-content` likewise
filled. This is the companion of the tick-146 *height* case, on the axis where it actually shows: the
"hug the contents" idiom — a `fit-content` badge/tag/pill, a `max-content` single-line label, and the
`width:fit-content; margin-inline:auto` centered-block-that-hugs pattern — silently stretched edge-to-edge.

**Cause.** All three intrinsic keywords collapse to `Dim::Auto` in both style paths (`stylo_map::size_to_dim`,
the hand parser). Only `height_intrinsic: bool` was retained (t146, for the abspos indefinite-height case) —
nothing carried the keyword on *width*, so a keyword width was indistinguishable from `auto` and took the
block auto-width **fill** branch (`cw − extra`). `stretch`/`-webkit-fill-available` were already correct
because they ARE definite fills.

**Fix.** A new `IntrinsicSize { MinContent, MaxContent, FitContent }` enum, stored as
`ComputedStyle::width_keyword: Option<IntrinsicSize>`, set in `stylo_map` (`size_intrinsic_kw`, matching the
`GenericSize` variants; `fit-content(<len>)` → `FitContent`) and in the hand parser at parity. Block width
resolution gains one arm before the auto-fill: `Dim::Auto if width_keyword.is_some()` →
`MinContent → min_content_width(node)`, `MaxContent → max_content_width(node)`,
`FitContent → shrink_to_fit(node, cw − extra)` — the *same* measure functions inline-block already uses, so
identical Bar-0/recursion profile, and they return **content-box** widths so the box-sizing subtraction
(guarded on `width != Auto`) correctly stays skipped. min/max-width clamps still apply after (CSS Sizing L3).
The auto-margin centering guard also widens to `width != Auto || width_keyword.is_some()` so a keyword width
(definite for margins) centers under `margin:auto`. Flex/grid **items** are taffy-decided (`taffy_known`) and
untouched; width-only scope because block auto-height already resolves to content height.

**Gate.** `width_fit_content_hugs`, `width_max_content_hugs`, `width_min_content_is_longest_word`,
`width_fit_content_still_clamped_by_max_width` (layout), the first three proven RED by the 300/1000px fill.
Sweep: css-sizing 14.8%→**15.1% (+5)**, css-flexbox 26.8%, css-grid 9.2%, css-position 28.8%,
CSS2/normal-flow 15.4% — neighbors flat, **HANG/CRASH 0**.
