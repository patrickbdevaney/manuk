# BOX LAYOUT — taffy mapping realities and quirks (flex / grid / sizing)

Manuk's flex and grid layout runs on a vendored **taffy 0.12** tree (`engine/layout/src/taffy_tree.rs`,
`flex.rs`). Block / inline / float / table nodes are Manuk-measured *leaves* of that tree; taffy only
lays out the flex/grid containers and their directly-nested flex/grid descendants. The mapping from
Manuk's `ComputedStyle` to `taffy::Style` (`to_taffy_style`) is where the realities below live.

## A mixed `calc()` must NOT collapse to one term — taffy has calc plumbing; wire it (tick 139)

`Dim::Calc { px, pct }` is Manuk's reduced linear form of a `calc()`: the used length is
`px + pct% · basis` (percentages stored 0–100). The **block** path resolves it correctly everywhere via
`Dim::resolve(reference, _)`. The **taffy** path did not: `dimension()`/`lp()`/`lp_auto()` mapped a
`Dim::Calc` to `length(px)` when `px != 0` **else** `percent(pct)` — i.e. it kept **one term and threw
the other away**. So `width: calc(100% − 250px)` (`px = −250, pct = 100`) became `length(−250)`, which a
flex item clamps to **0**. Every fixed-gutter sidebar split — `calc(100% − <rail>)` main, `calc(<fixed> +
100%)` panel — collapsed to nothing on a flex/grid parent while rendering fine on a block parent.

**The fix is not a hand-rolled resolver — taffy already has one.** taffy's `Dimension` /
`LengthPercentage` / `LengthPercentageAuto` each have a `::calc(ptr: *const ())` constructor (behind the
`calc` feature, which is in taffy's default set). `ptr` is an **opaque handle** taffy never dereferences;
it hands the handle back to `LayoutPartialTree::resolve_calc_value(&self, ptr, basis) -> f32` with the
definite basis at layout time, and expects the resolved px.

**The encoding (why it is an index, not an address).** `CompactLength::calc` asserts the handle is
**non-null and 8-byte aligned** (low 3 bits = 0) and round-trips it verbatim (the calc tag is `0b000`, so
no bits are stolen). We keep a `calc: Vec<(f32, f32)>` on the `TaffyDom` and encode the *index* as
`((idx + 1) << 3) as *const ()` — 8-aligned, non-null (the `+1` keeps index 0 off null), and an index
rather than a pointer into the `Vec`, so the `Vec` may reallocate freely without invalidating any live
handle. `resolve_calc_value` decodes `(ptr >> 3) − 1`, looks up `(px, pct)`, and returns `px + basis · pct
/ 100` — the *same* linear form the block path uses, so flex/grid items and block items now agree.

Only a **genuinely mixed** calc (both terms non-zero) needs the handle; a single-term calc still takes
taffy's `length`/`percent` fast path (no table entry). Gate: falsifiable unit test
`flex_item_calc_width_mixes_px_and_percent` + full-pipeline `flex_sidebar_calc_width_resolves_in_full_pipeline`
(a `calc(100% − 250px)` sidebar in a 1000px flex row must be 750px; the old collapse made it 0, and
reverting the wiring makes both tests go red).

**Bound.** Grid *track* sizing (`track_min`/`track_max`) still maps calc via the collapse — `calc()` in a
`grid-template-columns` track is rarer and is a follow-on. Sizes, min/max, inset, margin, padding and
flex-basis all resolve calc correctly.

## Why the WPT calc suites barely move on a layout-calc fix

`css/css-values`'s ~85 `calc(...)` tests are overwhelmingly **serialization / computed-value** tests
(`getComputedStyle` returns the calc expression) — a *cascade* axis, not a *layout* one — so a taffy-path
fix does not touch them. The `css/css-sizing` and `css/css-flexbox` calc tests that DO measure layout are
mostly **reftests** (Bar-2, skipped) or additionally depend on **intrinsic sizing** (min/max-content
propagation, still open). A layout-calc fix is therefore a *daily-driver render* win with a near-zero WPT
flip — gate it with a falsifiable layout assertion, not a subtest count.
