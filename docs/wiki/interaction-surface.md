# THE INTERACTION SURFACE — clicks, scroll, focus, and automation

> This topic file is load-bearing for the agent-native mission, so **capture here is expected on every
> commit that touches the interaction/automation surface** — a stricter bar than the rest of the wiki,
> not a competing system.

## The engine paints at scroll 0 and never tells anything the viewport moved

**This is the single biggest breadth-per-tick item on the board**, because it is **one missing
primitive, not six missing features.** A live viewport unlocks, all at once:

- lazy-loading images (`loading=lazy`, and every JS lazy-loader)
- list virtualisation (every large feed, table, and infinite scroll)
- `position: sticky` behaviour under scroll
- scroll-linked animation
- `IntersectionObserver`-driven content (which is *most* modern content-loading)

**Ask before re-entering JS.** The overwhelming majority of pages have **no** scroll listener, no
IntersectionObserver and no ResizeObserver. Re-entering JS on every wheel event for those pages is pure
cost — a rect-map rebuild, a JS call, and a timer pump, sixty times a second, to tell a page that is not
listening. `wants_view_events()` asks first.

## A click is a hit-test against the LAID-OUT boxes, not a DOM query

A gate that scored "clickability" by counting `<a href>` elements scored a browser that found **zero
links** as *perfectly clickable*. The hit-test reads the fragment tree; the DOM query does not.

## `window` must be an EventTarget

`window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'))` is how a router tells the app it navigated — and it was a
`TypeError`, with a whole listener registry sitting behind it.

# Backfill — mechanisms recovered from ticks 1–42 (pre-wiki)

## A control whose only effect is a LOG LINE is a dead affordance — and to the user it is a broken browser

Find-in-page and the bookmark toggle both **worked underneath** — and **drew no UI at all**, so pressing the
key did nothing visible. **Both shipped.**

**This is a class no feature-level test catches**, because every feature test asks whether the **engine** did
the thing, **not whether the USER could SEE that it did.**

**Two mechanical defences:** assert that every user-reachable control has an **observable** effect (and
**explicitly fail any whose stated effect is a tracing line**), and **make the toolbar's draw and hit-test
share ONE geometry function**, so what a user sees and what responds to a click **can never drift apart.**

## Hit-testing must break ties toward the DEEPER element, and must respect STACKING ORDER

- Resolving an area tie toward the **ancestor** made a click on a lone `<button>` inside a same-size
  `<form>` **"hit" the form.** Pre-order with `<=` resolves to the **deeper** element.
- **Deepest-wins alone lets you click THROUGH a `position:fixed`, high-z modal** to the content beneath it.
  **"Smallest containing box" is not the same as "topmost painted box."** Prefer the **highest effective
  stacking layer** containing the point, **then deepest within that layer** — so non-positioned pages (all
  z=0) are unchanged.

**The geometry problem underneath:** inline elements produce no layout box, so **`<a>` and `<button>` — the
very things one clicks — had NO GEOMETRY AT ALL** until text fragments started carrying their owning node;
and `<a><img></a>` had none until a boxless element's rect became the **union of its subtree's fragments AND
boxes.**

## Agent actions must go through the REAL hit-test, or agent testing is a privileged bypass

An agent action resolves to an a11y-tree node → **spatial hit-test via the primary layout engine** → **if
the target is occluded, `display:none`, or off-screen, the hit-test FAILS and the action is REJECTED,
exactly as it would for a human.**

> **That is precisely what makes agent-driven testing a valid differential oracle for interaction parity.**
> *The cost, stated plainly: the a11y tree must be computed-on-read and kept synchronously consistent with
> layout.*

## ONE a11y tree, THREE consumers — and web-agent research independently converged on it

Building the DOM→role+name+geometry tree **once** serves:

1. **the screen-reader product** (bridged via `accesskit` → Windows UIA / macOS NSAccessibility / Linux
   AT-SPI),
2. **the agent's structured observation channel** — WebArena-class research uses the accessibility tree as
   the **preferred** channel (*"a subset of the DOM with role/text/properties, structured yet more
   compact"*), read via **semantic roles** rather than raw pixels or full DOM,
3. **the interaction-parity oracle.**

**HTML-AAM implicit-role rules that actually bite:** `<a>` is a `link` **only with `href`**; `<section>` is
a `region` **only when named**; `<th scope=row>` → `rowheader`; an explicit `role=` honours
**first-valid-token-wins**; **`<img alt="">` is presentational — the node is dropped but its CHILDREN are
REPARENTED.**

## Role + accessible-name is the right primary locator vocabulary

It is **semantic rather than structural** (it survives CSS and DOM refactors), it matches how an LLM reasons
(*"the **Sign in** button"*), and it is **injection-resistant in a way CSS selectors are not.**

**External a11y-first agents are sunk by legacy UIs that render invisibly to the a11y tree — but because we
COMPUTE the tree internally, we can offer role/name locators synchronously with a geometry/visibility
fallback when a11y metadata is missing.** A structural CSS escape hatch stays available, **but not as the
primary mode.**

## The stable agent handle should be the arena `NodeId` itself

**CDP's nodeId/backendNodeId split is accidental complexity** — it exists *because* it crosses a process
boundary. Ladybird's WebDriver element reference **IS** the DOM node's `UniqueNodeID` stringified, with a
staleness check.

Our arena already has `NodeId`, and `A11yNode.node` already carried it; it simply **was not surfaced as a
handle**, which forced the agent to **re-resolve the whole tree on every call.** The pairing that makes it
safe is the **generational `NodeId`** — a stale handle after slot reuse **fails loudly** rather than
silently aliasing a different element.

> **The in-process advantage IS the absence of a delta-serializer and a dual node-ID space.** Every
> CDP/WebDriver stack needs both *because* it crosses a process boundary. This is also what makes a live
> **`Handoff`** possible: it **MOVES the live `Page`** — DOM mutations, form values, scroll, nav stack —
> instead of re-fetching, *and re-fetching would lose exactly what matters (a logged-in page, a half-filled
> form).*

## Synchronous truthful READINESS is literally inexpressible over CDP/BiDi — that is the differentiation surface

**Readiness is the #1 flakiness source in all web automation.** Playwright's own docs concede network-idle
*"does not work for state updates triggered by client-side events, focus changes, or mount-time effects"* and
**never settles in SPAs holding long-lived websockets**; **BiDi still lacks an event distinguishing
navigation COMMIT from COMPLETE.**

**An in-process engine can block on the REAL lifecycle signal** — style clean, layout clean, microtask queue
drained, a *specific* fetch resolved — **because it owns the arena.** The same ownership enables a **race-free
semantic DOM diff computed BETWEEN JS turns**, which no socket-based protocol can offer.

## WebDriver BiDi, not CDP — and driving a REAL client found five bugs a spec read did not

CDP is **Chromium-only and not a standard**; **WebDriver BiDi is the W3C standard** (JSON-RPC over WebSocket,
WPT-tested), Firefox has dropped experimental CDP in its favour, and it makes the engine
**Puppeteer/Playwright-drivable.**

**Bugs a spec read missed:** `browser.getUserContexts` is required **before** any context work;
`browsingContext.contextCreated` **must be emitted BEFORE the `create` reply** (clients build their map from
the *event* and look the id up the instant the command resolves); context info must be **complete**
(`parent`, `userContext`) **or clients silently drop the event**; `newPage()` issues
`browsingContext.setViewport`; and **`goto` needs the full lifecycle** — `navigationStarted` before the
reply, then `domContentLoaded` + `load` carrying **the same `navigation` id** and a numeric timestamp, **or
`goto` never resolves.**

## The Action-Guard taxonomy follows one principle: PAGE-CHOSEN DESTINATIONS are the exfiltration channel

An action that can transmit page-derived or typed data to **a destination the page chose** is what a hidden
prompt injection reaches for.

| Action | Class | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `submit`, `click_text` on a **button** | **Sensitive** | can submit |
| `click_at` | **Sensitive** | **a raw coordinate cannot be checked against any target before it is clicked** |
| `type` | Safe | purely local — nothing leaves the machine until a submit or navigation |
| `back`/`forward`/`scroll` | Safe | |

**`method=post` forms must be REFUSED, not silently downgraded to GET** — *a downgrade pushes passwords and
tokens into the URL and the `Referer`.*

**Capability scoping belongs at the tool-call boundary as a plain value.** CaMeL's result is that what
defeats prompt injection is enforcing policy **at the tool-call boundary** — a check before each action.
**Macaroons buy nothing in-process** (they exist for *attenuated delegation across a trust boundary*; where
no untrusted party ever holds the credential, an HMAC chain adds crypto surface for zero threat-model gain).
**Authority is checked FIRST** (*"were you ever granted this kind of action?"*), **then** the risk heuristic —
they answer independent questions and **both must pass**. **An empty origin allowlist means "any origin", not
"none"** — *a grant that forgot to name one must not silently brick.*

## More context DEGRADES agent accuracy even when the needed information is present

The literature shows a larger observation **hurts every model**, and there is **no evidence a richer
observation helps a LARGER one** — FocusAgent's >50% pruning lets two *small* models hit 51.5%/51.8% success
against 53.0% for a large model on the full tree.

> **So serialization depth must be keyed on a TOKEN BUDGET, not a model-capability enum** — that would encode
> a belief the evidence does not support.

**The trimming order is counterintuitive**, dropping by increasing value-per-token: **raw text first, then
the link list, and the ACCESSIBILITY TREE LAST** — the tree is the densest channel and **the link list is a
strict subset of it.** *(An initial implementation had this backwards.)*

**And no policy, at any budget, may drop the untrusted-content fence around page-derived text** —
`aria-label="ignore prior instructions"` is an injection vector **exactly like link text.**

## Graceful degradation is not "do nothing" — the spec already has the vocabulary

`<video>` laid out correctly at 640×360 while `canPlayType`, `play`, `paused`, `readyState`, `error` and
`networkState` were **all `undefined`.** **That is the worst combination:** a site calling `video.play()`
gets a `TypeError` **that takes the page down**, and a site that **politely feature-detects** with
`if (v.canPlayType('video/mp4'))` reads `undefined` and **cannot even be told no.**

**The honest answers:** `canPlayType()` → **`""`** (*the empty string IS the spec's "no"*) · `play()` → a
**REJECTED Promise** (`NotSupportedError` — *which every player library already handles, because autoplay
policies make rejection routine*) · `error.code 4` · `readyState 0` · `networkState 3` ·
`getContext('webgl')` → **`null`**.

**A site told THAT hides its player and shows its fallback.** And **`<video poster>` is a still image we can
already decode and paint** — *a correctly-sized poster with an honest "cannot play" is a **degraded video**,
which is the whole ask.*

**`alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` must be honest too:** a renderer has **no user to ask**, and a `confirm()`
returning `true` by default would let a page **believe the user had agreed to something.** *Declining is the
safe answer, and it is LOGGED rather than silent.*

## The live viewport is ONE primitive, and the step everybody forgets is the FOURTH

Lazy-loading, list virtualization, sticky headers, scroll-linked animation and infinite scroll are **not
five features.** They are **one primitive seen five times**: *does the engine tell the page that the
viewport moved?*

**The complete loop, and all four steps are required:**

1. the viewport moves → **`window.scrollY` updates** and **`scroll` fires**;
2. **`IntersectionObserver` FIRES** — this, not `scroll` handlers, is what *most* modern content-loading is
   built on;
3. the callback swaps **`img.src = img.dataset.src`** — the universal lazy-load pattern;
4. **the engine NOTICES that new URL and FETCHES it.**

> **Step 4 is the one everybody forgets.** An engine that fires the observer and never fetches what the
> observer asked for has implemented the **appearance** of lazy-loading and none of the substance: the page
> requests the image and it never arrives. **Firing the observer is not the feature. The image ARRIVING is
> the feature.**

**Ask before re-entering JS.** The overwhelming majority of pages register no scroll listener and no
observer; re-entering JS on every wheel event for those is pure cost.

## Element scrolling — and the zero that broke every virtualised list

`element.scrollTop` was the roadmap's #2 item, and the gap was not absence. It was a **lie on both sides**:

* reading gave `undefined`;
* writing quietly created a plain JavaScript own-property. It scrolled nothing. It threw nothing.

So a virtualised list set it, read it back, got its own value, and believed it had worked.

### The worse bug underneath

`clientWidth`, `clientHeight`, `scrollWidth`, `scrollHeight` all **existed** — every one of them aliased to
`offsetWidth`/`offsetHeight`, i.e. the element's own border box. Which means:

> **`scrollHeight - clientHeight` was always ZERO.**

That is precisely the number every virtualised list divides by to decide which slice of the data to render.
`undefined` fails loudly. **Zero fails as *"there is nothing to scroll"*** — and the list renders one screen
of rows and stops, on a page that looks fine.

It surfaced only because two numbers disagreed: the setter's clamp computed 900 correctly (from the real
geometry) while the getter reported 100 (from the alias). **Two numbers that disagree about the same fact
mean one of them is not reading what it thinks it is.**

### How it works, and why the painter needed no changes

A scroll container's clip is **already** its padding box (that is what `overflow` has always done here). So
translating its subtree up by `scrollTop` slides content out of that clip exactly as a real scroll does, and
anything scrolled out of view is clipped away **for free, because it was always going to be**.

* `LayoutBox::translate(dx, dy)` moves a box and its whole subtree — including the **list marker**, which it
  did not before (a latent bug: a `<ul>` inside a float would have kept its bullets behind while its text
  moved).
* `Page::set_element_scroll` translates by the **delta**, never the absolute offset. The tree already carries
  the old one; translating by the absolute value on every assignment scrolls cumulatively, which looks
  exactly like a runaway-scroll bug.
* `Page::reapply_scroll_offsets()` runs after **every** re-layout. Layout starts from zero each time, so
  without this the user types in a chat box and the list jumps back to the top.

### The contract with JavaScript

The host owns the layout tree, so the host owns the numbers. `Page` publishes
`[scrollTop, scrollLeft, scrollHeight, scrollWidth, clientHeight, clientWidth]` per container before **every**
script round — including the *inline* one, which runs before a `Page` even exists, because a virtualised list
reads `clientHeight` at boot and a capability that only works after the deferred pass works on half the web.

The setter **clamps in the native**, so `el.scrollTop = 1e9; el.scrollTop` reads back the real maximum on the
very next line. A script that scrolls to a huge number to reach the bottom is idiomatic; reading back `1e9`
makes every `atBottom` check false forever.

Non-scroll-containers fall back to their own box for `clientHeight`/`scrollHeight` — a plain `<div>` still has
a `clientHeight`, and returning zero for every ordinary element would be a far bigger regression than the bug
being fixed.

## `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)` bridges the layout-rect snapshot, not a second hit-tester

A genuinely missing DOM API (`css-transforms` alone: 84 `is not a function` failures; also drag-and-drop,
tooltips, custom controls). Implemented over the binding's existing `LAYOUT_RECTS_PTR` snapshot: among
laid-out **element** boxes containing the client point, return the **deepest** — smallest border-box area,
later document order on a tie (children paint over their parents). A miss, or a non-finite/absent
coordinate, returns `null` (CSSOM-View). Registered on both document setups; wrapped via
`return_node_or_null` (the same reflector path as `querySelector`).

**Honest bounds, in the code and stated up front:** the rects are **pre-transform**, so a `transform`ed
hit area isn't yet accounted for, and scroll offset is assumed zero (client ≈ layout coords for an
unscrolled page). Even so it moved css-transforms 20 → 45 (+25) — the tests whose coords fall in the
untransformed box. Transform-aware hit-testing (apply the matrix to the box → point-in-quad) is the
follow-on for the remaining transformed cases. It reuses the SAME geometry the a11y `hit_test` uses, so
the agent surface and page JS agree on what is at a point. [[dom-semantics]]

## `element.getClientRects()` reuses the layout snapshot, like getBoundingClientRect

A missing CSSOM-View API. Returns a DOMRectList of the element's border boxes from the same `LAYOUT_RECTS`
snapshot `getBoundingClientRect` reads: a laid-out element → one rect (its bounding box); a `display:none`
/ unlaid-out element → an **empty** list (NOT a zero rect — that is the distinction from
`getBoundingClientRect`, which returns all-zeros). Provides `.item(i)` + indexed access. **Honest bound:**
an inline box that wraps across lines has several client rects; we return the single bounding box (the
block/replaced majority the snapshot holds). Ratchet-neutral at introduction (the lone WPT reference sits
in a multi-assertion test that fails elsewhere too) — landed as correct capability real sites call
constantly, tick-97-style. [[dom-semantics]]

## `offsetLeft`/`offsetTop` are offsetParent-relative, and `offsetParent` exists (tick 138)

**The single largest CSS-layout lever, and it was not a layout bug at all — it was a coordinate space.**
`offsetLeft`/`offsetTop` returned the element's **absolute page X/Y** (`LAYOUT_RECTS[node]` directly). But
CSSOM-View defines them relative to the **offsetParent's padding edge** — "where is this box inside its
positioned container". Absolute coords are only correct when the offsetParent sits at the page origin,
which is the exception, not the rule. So a flex/grid item inside any `position:relative` container reported
its viewport coordinate, and `check-layout-th.js` — which asserts `el.offsetLeft` against a
**container-relative** `data-offset-x` — failed across the whole layout suite. It also meant every popup /
tooltip / drag library that positions at `el.offsetLeft` landed in the wrong place.

**`offsetParent` (`offset_parent()` in `dom_bindings.rs`)** follows CSSOM-View exactly: `null` for the root
element, the body, a `position:fixed` box, or a boxless element (step 1); otherwise the nearest ancestor
that is **positioned**, is the **body**, or — only when the element itself is `static` — a `td`/`th`/`table`
(step 2). Tag detection leans on the arena storing HTML tag names lowercased.

**The offset value (`el_offset_pos()`):** the body/boxless → `0`; **no** offsetParent → the border-edge
coordinate relative to the ICB, i.e. the old absolute value (correct for that case); **with** an
offsetParent → `self.borderEdge − (offsetParent.borderBoxEdge + offsetParent.borderWidth)`, i.e. subtract
the offsetParent's **padding-edge origin**. Rounded to a `long` last (CSSOM rounds; `check-layout` tolerates
±1px). The gate `g_offset_parent` pins both facts with an abspos item in a bordered relative container
(`offsetLeft==10`, not the absolute `45`) — proving offsetParent-relativity AND the border subtraction in
one number. **MEASURED:** css-flexbox 6.2%→24.7% (+665), css-grid 5.3%→9.0% (+107), css-sizing 12.0%→13.6%,
css-position +5; Bar 0 clean; html/dom/dom unregressed. All four suites share `check-layout-th.js`, so one
coordinate-space fix flipped them together. [[dom-semantics]] [[css-cascade]]

## `IntersectionObserver.rootMargin` is a 4-side shorthand, and the BOTTOM side is the whole feature (tick 140)

`rootMargin` grows the observer's root rectangle so a sentinel fires *before* it is actually on screen —
the mechanism every infinite feed uses to load its next page early. It is a **CSS margin shorthand**
(`all` | `V H` | `T H B` | `T R B L`), px or `%`, and the sides are **asymmetric**: the near-universal
idiom `rootMargin: '0px 0px 300px 0px'` extends only the **bottom** edge. The old parse took a single token
(`.split(/\s+/)[0]`) and applied it symmetrically — so that idiom resolved to `0`, the bottom margin was
silently dropped, and the feed loaded **late or never** (the sentinel had to be fully visible before
`observe`'s callback saw `isIntersecting`). This is a **stub-shaped** failure: the API is present, the
option is accepted, and it just quietly does nothing — the library feature-detects fine and never fires.

**Fix (`dom_bindings.rs`, `g.IntersectionObserver`):** parse `rootMargin` into `{top,right,bottom,left}`,
each `{v, pct}`, with the standard shorthand fallbacks (`right←top`, `bottom←top`, `left←right`). In
`__runObservers`, resolve top/bottom per-side (a `%` is a fraction of the viewport **height**) and grow the
intersection band asymmetrically: `min(b, bottom+marginBottom) − max(t, top−marginTop)`.

**Tick 141 made the intersection 2-D** (the follow-on tick 140 named). The old test was vertical-overlap
only, so an element vertically in view but scrolled off to the **side** of a horizontal carousel reported
`isIntersecting=true` and every off-screen slide eager-loaded. Now `visX = min(right, vw+mRight) −
max(left, 0−mLeft)` runs alongside the vertical band (`%` on left/right is a fraction of viewport **width**),
`isIntersecting = visX>0 && visY>0`, and `intersectionRatio = visX·visY / (w·h)`. This is also the only
consumer of the `left`/`right` margins tick 140 parsed. The page is assumed **not** horizontally scrolled
(root x-band `[0, vw]`), which is ~all real layouts. Gate scenario 21c: an element at x=800 in a 400px
viewport must NOT intersect (`hplain:false`); a `'0px 500px 0px 0px'` right margin that reaches it must
(`hright:true`). Proven RED on the vertical-only code (`hplain:true`).

**Gate** (`js_conformance` scenario 21b): a sentinel 20px **below** a 600px viewport (top=620). A plain
`rootMargin:'0px'` observer must report it **not** intersecting; a `'0px 0px 200px 0px'` observer must
report it **intersecting with no scroll at all**. Proven RED on the old parse (`prefetch:false`), GREEN
after. No local WPT `intersection-observer/` suite exists, so this capability is pinned by the falsifiable
conformance gate, not a subtest count. [[dom-semantics]]

## `getComputedStyle` resolves the flexbox longhands, not just the box model (tick 142)

**The gap.** `computed_style_js` (`dom_bindings.rs`) surfaced the box model (width/margins/padding/inset),
colors, fonts, `display`/`position`/`transform` — but **no flex longhand**. So
`getComputedStyle(el).alignItems`, `.justifyContent`, `.flexDirection`, `.flexWrap`, `.flexGrow`,
`.flexShrink`, `.flexBasis`, `.alignSelf`, `.rowGap`/`.columnGap` all read back `undefined`. A framework
that measures a flex container, a CSS-in-JS lib re-reading resolved values, or an animation lib
interpolating `flex-grow` got `undefined` concatenated into its logic. `ComputedStyle` **already stored
every one of these fields** — they were computed at cascade time and simply never surfaced to JS. Pure
wiring, not new layout.

**Fix.** Serialize each stored field to its CSS resolved value — the exact keyword Chrome returns
(`flex-start`/`space-between`/`nowrap`/`column-reverse`/…), `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink` as bare numbers,
`flex-basis` via `dim_css`, `align-self: None → "auto"` — add the ten camelCase keys to the object literal,
and register the kebab→camel names in `getPropertyValue`'s map (so `getPropertyValue('flex-direction')`
reaches the same value). `align-content` and `order` are **not** on `ComputedStyle`, so they stay
unserialized rather than guessing a wrong default.

**Strictly non-regressing:** nothing read these keys before (they were `undefined`), so the change can only
flip failing reads, never break a green one. **Measured:** `css/css-flexbox` 888→945 (+57;
getcomputedstyle 2/78→59/78), `css/css-grid` 150→257 (+107) — grid's getcomputedstyle files read the *same*
`justify-content`/`align-items` resolved values, so one serialization fix flipped both suites (~+164).

**Gate** (`js_conformance` scenario 23): a `flex-direction:column;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;
align-items:center` container with a `flex-grow:2;flex-shrink:0;flex-basis:100px;align-self:flex-end` child
must read back `column|wrap|space-between|center|2|0|100px|flex-end|column` (the last via `getPropertyValue`).
Proven RED by stashing the serialization — the whole join was `undefined|…`. [[dom-semantics]]

## `getComputedStyle` exposes the box-model longhands too (tick 143)

Extending tick 142's pattern: `boxSizing`, `minWidth`/`maxWidth`/`minHeight`/`maxHeight` also read back
`undefined` before. `box-sizing` is the single most-read layout flag in framework measurement code (*is this
a border-box, so does my width math include padding?*). All four are stored+computed on `ComputedStyle`;
this is pure serialization wiring. **The subtle rule:** `max-*` uses `Dim::Auto` for *unconstrained*, whose
resolved value is **`none`**, not `auto` (only `min-*` → `auto`) — a `max_dim` helper maps `Auto → "none"`.
Non-regressing (nothing read these before). Measured +4 (`css-flexbox`); the bulk of box-model gCS tests are
the `css/cssom` battery, absent from the local corpus, so the capability is pinned by `js_conformance`
scenario 24 (`box-sizing:border-box;min-width:50px;max-width:300px;min-height:10px` →
`border-box|50px|300px|10px|none|border-box`), proven RED by stashing the fix. [[dom-semantics]]

## Typing must fire an `input` event, or every controlled component reverts the keystroke (tick 175)

A framework text field is a **controlled component**: `<input value={state} onChange={e =>
setState(e.target.value)}>`. The value the user sees is JS state, and the field learns a key was
pressed **only from the `input` event** — React's `onChange` (which is really the `input` event), Vue's
`v-model`, Svelte's `bind:value` all update their state there, then re-render and write the state back
into the field. So if a keystroke does not fire `input`, the sequence is: user types → the DOM `value`
changes → but state does not → the component re-renders from its *stale* state → and **overwrites the
field with the old value**. The keystroke is visibly reverted. Every controlled input in every SPA is
unusable.

The shell's `edit_focused_input` did exactly the wrong thing: it mutated the `value` attribute
directly (`dom_mut().set_attr(node, "value", …)`) and fired **nothing**. (There was a
`Page::dispatch_type` that fired `input`+`change`, but it had **zero callers** — a mechanism wired to
nothing, the recurring failure this project keeps catching. See [[architecture]] "the mechanism EXISTED
and was wired to nothing".)

**The fix is a focused `Page::dispatch_input(node, value)`** — set the value, then fire **`input`**
(and only `input`) — which the shell now calls per keystroke. It is deliberately not
`dispatch_type`'s `input`+`change`: `change` is a **commit** event (blur / Enter), and firing it on
every keystroke is wrong — a handler that validates or submits on `change` would run on every
character. The click path already worked this way (`dispatch_click` fires the real `click`); this is
the same contract for the keyboard. Gated by `js_conformance` scenario 27: an `input` listener mirrors
`event.target.value`, two keystrokes update it to `hi` then `hip`, and the `change` counter stays `0`.
Residue: `change`-on-blur (when the field loses focus) and `keydown`/`keyup`/`beforeinput` are still
unfired — separate keyboard-event mechanisms; `input` is the one the controlled-component contract
turns on.

## Blur fires `change` then `blur` — field-level validation runs on commit (tick 176)

The commit half of the input/change pair (tick 175 was the keystroke half). A form validates a field
the moment you *leave* it — "email invalid", "username taken", the red border — and it hangs that on
the `change` and `blur` events. The shell cleared `focused_input` on click-away / Escape / submit and
fired **nothing**, so on-blur validation never ran and the field never committed.

**`Page::dispatch_blur(node, value_changed)`** fires `change` (only when `value_changed`) then `blur`.
The `value_changed` guard is not optional: `change` fires *only if the value differs from when the
field gained focus* — a user who tabs through a field without editing must not trigger its
change-validator. The shell tracks that with a `focus_value` snapshot taken in `focus_input(node)`
(and on programmatic `.focus()`); `blur_focused_input()` compares the current value against it, fires
`dispatch_blur` with the result, and is now the single chokepoint every user-initiated focus loss goes
through — click-away (`PageAction::Link`/`Submit`/`Clear`), focusing a *different* field
(`focus_input` blurs the old first), Escape, and Enter (`submit_focused_form` commits before it
submits, so on-blur validation runs before the POST).

Gated by `js_conformance` scenario 28: a blur with no change fires `blur` only; after an edit, blur
fires `change` then `blur` (order matters). Residue: a **programmatic** focus move (page calls
`.focus()` on another field) records the new `focus_value` but does not yet fire `blur` on the old
field; `focus`/`focusin`/`focusout` and `keydown`/`keyup` are separate mechanisms. [[dom-semantics]]

## `keydown` fires with the real `key`, and `preventDefault()` suppresses the default (tick 178)

The keyboard's `click`: a page intercepts a key by listening for `keydown` and calling
`preventDefault()`. The canonical case is the chat/comment composer — `onKeyDown` catches **Enter**,
calls `preventDefault()`, and sends the message itself instead of letting the browser submit the form
(Shift+Enter inserts a newline). A combobox/listbox swallows **ArrowDown** to move its highlight. None
of this worked: the shell went straight from a keypress to its own default action (submit / edit /
blur) and dispatched no `keydown`, so the page never saw the key and could never pre-empt it.

**`Page::dispatch_key(node, "keydown", key)` fires a real keyboard event and returns whether the
default should proceed** (`false` = a handler called `preventDefault`). The event carries `key` (the
modern property — `"Enter"`, `"a"`, `"ArrowDown"`) *and* `keyCode`/`which` (the legacy pair handlers
still read — Enter is 13, a letter is its uppercase code), because `__dispatchEvent` already accepts an
event **object** and preserves its fields (see "its key... all have to survive"). The shell now fires
`keydown` on the focused field before acting, and if the page prevents the default it stops — the Enter
does not submit, the character is not inserted. Composes with the input/change/blur trilogy: `keydown`
(pre-empt) → the default (which fires `input`) → `change`/`blur` on commit.

Gated by `js_conformance` scenario 30: a handler reads `event.key`/`event.keyCode` (`a:65`), and
`preventDefault()` on Enter makes `dispatch_key` return false (`Enter:13`). Residue: `keyup` is not yet
fired (the shell fires `keydown` only — the pre-empt-the-default half is what the value is); `event.code`
(physical key) equals `key` for named keys but approximates for characters; keys the shell does not
surface (function keys, IME composition) dispatch nothing. [[dom-semantics]]

## `navigator.clipboard.writeText` — the "copy" button actually copies (tick 179)

Copy-to-clipboard is one of the most common single-purpose buttons on the web: the code-block copy
icon, "copy share link", "copy API key", "copy to clipboard" on a coupon. They all call
`navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)`. `navigator.clipboard` was **absent**, so that call threw on
`undefined` inside the click handler and the button silently did nothing — a dead affordance, the
exact §1.8 failure the project treats as "broken to the user."

The shell already owns a real OS clipboard (`arboard`, wired to Ctrl+C/V). The fix bridges the page to
it with the host-queue pattern used by `window.open`/`postMessage`: a native `__clipboardWrite(text)`
pushes onto a process-thread-local queue; `navigator.clipboard.writeText` calls it and returns the
spec's resolved `Promise<void>`; the shell drains the queue after a click dispatch (`pump_clipboard`,
beside `handle_window_opens`) and writes the last value to the OS clipboard. `readText` resolves with
the last text this page wrote — a genuine within-page round-trip — but does **not** read the OS
clipboard (reading what another app copied is a permission-gated capability, a follow-on; pretending
to would be a lie, not a feature).

Gated by `js_conformance` scenario 31: a copy button whose click calls `writeText('copied-value-42')`;
after `dispatch_click`, `take_clipboard_writes()` returns exactly that text (and nothing before the
click). Residue: the legacy `document.execCommand('copy')` path is not wired; a write triggered off
the click path (a timer, a fetch reaction) is not yet pumped. [[js-engine]]

## `navigator.clipboard.read`/`readText` — PASTE reads the real OS clipboard (tick 287)

The copy half above worked; PASTE did not. `readText()` returned only the text this page had itself
written, so a "paste from clipboard" button, a rich-text editor, or an AI-chat screenshot drop zone
that reads `navigator.clipboard.readText()` came back **empty** whenever the user had copied something
in another application — which is the entire point of paste.

The fix adds the READ direction of the clipboard bridge, symmetric to the write queue. A `HOST_CLIPBOARD`
process-thread-local holds the real OS-clipboard text; the host seeds it via
`manuk_js::set_host_clipboard(text)` (from `arboard`, the same OS clipboard the write side drains to),
and a native `__clipboardRead()` returns it. `readText()` pulls from that bridge, falling back to the
page's own last write; `clipboard_write` also updates the cell, so a same-page copy→paste round-trips
one clipboard. `read()` returns real `ClipboardItem`s — `.types` plus `.getType(mime)` → `Blob` — so a
paste handler that branches on `image/png` vs `text/plain` finds only the type actually present.

### The teeth `G_CLIPBOARD_READ` uses

`external` — `readText()` must resolve to host-seeded text the page never wrote (an echo of the page's
own write fails). `absent-rejects` — `getType('image/png')` on a text-only item must **reject**, because
a `ClipboardItem` is keyed by the types it holds (a shim that resolves every type fails). `roundtrip` —
`writeText(x)` then `readText()` returns `x`. The `external` claim was demonstrated red (reverting
`readText` to the self-echo) before the tick landed.

**Honest limit:** `text/plain` only. Binary image blobs on the OS clipboard (paste-a-screenshot) need a
binary bridge and are the follow-on; the constellation row is `partial`, not `works`. [[js-engine]]

## `keyup` fires on key release — the settled-value half of the keyboard trio (tick 180)

A large slice of the web — jQuery-era search boxes, character counters, keyboard-shortcut-release
logic — binds `keyup`, **not** `keydown`, because it wants the field's *settled* value after the
keystroke has applied. The shell fired `keydown` (tick 178) and `input` (tick 175) on key PRESS but
processed only `ElementState::Pressed`, dropping every `ElementState::Released` — so a `keyup`
listener never ran and those boxes stayed dead.

`Page::dispatch_key` was already generic over the event type (`"keydown"`/`"keyup"`), so the fix is
purely shell wiring: on key release, `dispatch_keyup` fires `keyup` on the focused field via the same
`key_name_for_dispatch` mapping keydown uses. No default action is associated with `keyup`, so
`dispatch_key`'s "should the default proceed" return is irrelevant and ignored. Completes the trio:
`keydown` (pre-empt) → `input` (per-keystroke) → `keyup` (release). Modifier-only releases
(Ctrl/Shift/Alt) surface no key name, so no spurious `keyup` fires; no focused field → nothing fires.

Gated by `js_conformance` scenario 32: a `keyup` handler reads `event.key`/`event.keyCode`;
`dispatch_key(node,"keyup","x",…)` fires it and the handler records `x:88` (nothing before release).
Residue: `keyup` fires only for a focused text field (not globally on the document), and `event.code`
inherits the same key-name approximation as `keydown`. [[dom-semantics]]

## A11y node STATES — the agent can confirm its own action (tick 199)

`A11yNode` carried `role`, `name`, `bbox`, `z` — and nothing about state. So the observation an agent
read was:

```text
checkbox "Remember me"      <- before the click
checkbox "Remember me"      <- after the click
```

Byte-identical. **An agent that cannot observe the result of its own action cannot verify it**: it
proceeds on faith, or re-clicks and toggles the setting straight back off. This is the agentic moat,
not an accessibility nicety — which is why the gate asserts the *difference between two snapshots*
rather than the presence of a field.

**`A11yState`** hangs off every node: `checked` (tri-state), `expanded`, `selected`, `disabled`,
`required`, `readonly`, `focused`, `value`.

**`Option` means NOT APPLICABLE, not false.** A link is not "unchecked" — it has no checkedness, and
reporting `checked: false` on it would be a lie an agent could act on. Only controls that can carry a
state report one.

**Checkedness is tri-state.** `mixed` is the real third value a "select all" parent checkbox shows;
flattening it to `false` tells an agent the opposite of what the page means.

**ARIA wins over the native attribute** where both are present — the cascade assistive tech uses. An
author who wrote `aria-checked="mixed"` on a checkbox means it, and the native attribute cannot
express `mixed` at all.

**Script-driven state is visible** because `el.checked = true` writes the `checked` *attribute*
through the reflector, so reading the attribute sees script state as well as authored state. That is
what makes "click, then read back" work at all.

**Rendering is signal, not noise**: `A11yState::render()` returns an empty string when there is no
state, so a static document's observation lines are unchanged; a control appends ` [checked disabled
value="ada"]`.

**Focus is host-owned.** The shell tracks the focused element and publishes it into the JS world via
`set_view_state`, so it cannot be read back out of the DOM. `build_tree_with_focus` /
`Page::a11y_tree_with_focus` take it from a caller that knows; the plain builders leave `focused`
false rather than guessing.

**Adding a field to a shared struct is a workspace-wide edit** — `A11yNode` literals live in
`agent/src/{targeting,grounding,automation}.rs` as well as the a11y crate's own tests. Grep every
crate for the constructor, not just the defining one.

Residue: `disabled` does not yet inherit from an ancestor `<fieldset disabled>` or `aria-disabled`
container; no `aria-valuemin`/`valuemax`/`valuetext`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-busy`, `aria-pressed`,
`aria-current`, or `aria-level`; `A11yDiff` still diffs on `(role, name)` only, so a pure state change
shows up in `to_observation_lines()` but not in `diff()`. **The larger gap this exposes:
`element.click()` fires the event but does not run activation behaviour** (a click does not itself
toggle a checkbox — see `el_click`), so the read-back confirms script-driven and authored state today;
native activation is its own tick.

## Click ACTIVATION behaviour — the checkbox actually ticks (tick 208)

`dispatch_click` fired the *event* and stopped there. It ran no **activation behaviour**, so clicking
a checkbox left it unchecked, clicking a radio selected nothing, and no `input`/`change` ever fired.
Tick 199 gave the agent the ability to read control state back and flagged this as the thing that
made the read-back only half useful: an agent could see a checkbox was unchecked, click it, and see
it still unchecked.

**The ordering is the subtle half, and getting it backwards still passes a naive test.** The toggle
happens **before** the click event is dispatched, which is why a real handler reading `this.checked`
sees the NEW state. Toggling afterwards would end in the same final state while handing every handler
on the web a stale value — so the gate asserts what the handler *saw*, not just where things landed.

- **checkbox** — toggles. `preventDefault()` on the click undoes it (the "canceled activation
  steps"), which is what a page validating before allowing a toggle depends on.
- **radio** — is a **group, not a toggle**. Clicking one deselects its peers, grouped by `name`
  (which is how the form serialises); a radio never unchecks itself; a different `name` group is
  untouched. Two checked radios in one group means the form submits the wrong value.
- **`input` then `change`**, in that order, both after the state is committed — every
  controlled-component binding is written for exactly that.

Gated by `g_click_activation`: the box ticks and unticks; the handler log reads
`click:true input:true change:true click:false input:false change:false` (the ordering claim);
`preventDefault()` leaves the box unticked; selecting a radio deselects its group peer and not the
other group; and an already-selected radio stays selected. Proven RED by returning no activation —
the box never ticks and the log's `click:true` collapses.

Residue: only checkbox and radio activate. A link still does not navigate and a submit button does
not submit **from `element.click()`** (the native GUI paths handle those separately, so this is a
gap in the scripted/agent path specifically); `<select>`/`<option>` selection, and the
`labels`→control forwarding (clicking a `<label>` should activate its control) are not done either.

## `<label>` forwards its click to the control (tick 209)

Clicking a `<label>` did nothing. That is the label being *how most checkboxes on the web are
actually clicked* — the visible target is the text, not the 12px box.

**For an agent it is worse than for a person.** The label is what carries the accessible name, so
"click the Remember me checkbox" resolves to the label, clicks it, and nothing happens — and a click
that does nothing is indistinguishable from a control that does nothing.

Both association forms are handled: `for="id"` (resolved to a **labelable** element — `input`,
`select`, `textarea`, `button`, `meter`), and a label **wrapping** its control (first labelable
descendant). A `for` naming nothing labelable labels nothing and does *not* fall back to a
descendant, because the author said which control they meant.

**The recursion trap.** A control nested inside its own label is the common markup, and forwarding
naively means the control's own click forwards back through the label forever — or double-toggles and
so appears to do nothing at all. Forwarding only happens when the clicked node *is* the label, which
is what stops it.

**The label's own click still fires and can still be cancelled.** `preventDefault()` on the label
stops the control being activated, exactly as it does on the control itself.

Gated by `g_label_click`: a `for=` label ticks and unticks its box; a wrapping label forwards to its
descendant; clicking the control *inside* its own label toggles exactly once; a cancelled label click
does not reach the control; a label pointing at nothing activates nothing and does not panic. Proven
RED by not forwarding — the box never ticks.

## A disabled control is inert — and a script-free form still works (tick 210)

Two things, found together because the gate for the first exposed the second.

**A disabled control does not activate.** Ticks 208/209 ran activation without checking, so clicking
a disabled checkbox ticked it, and so did clicking its label. A disabled control is not "styled grey"
— it is inert, and clicking it must leave the page exactly as it was.

**For an agent this is worse than cosmetic**, which is why it earns its own gate: the agent ticks a
disabled consent box, reads the state back (tick 199 gave it that), sees it ticked, and reports
success on a form the server will reject. **A wrong observation is more expensive than a failed
action, because nothing downstream questions it.** So the a11y tree was fixed in the same tick:
`disabled` now inherits from an ancestor `<fieldset disabled>` there too, and the gate asserts the
tree and the activation path **agree** — a tree that said "actionable" about something inert would
be the same failure one layer up.

**`<fieldset disabled>` inheritance is not an edge case.** Disabling a whole step of a multi-step
form with one fieldset is the idiomatic way to do it; checking only the control's own attribute
leaves every control in that step live. Only a `<fieldset>` propagates disabledness — a disabled
`<div>` means nothing.

**The second finding: activation was gated on having a JS context.** `dispatch_click` returned early
when `self.js` was `None`, so **a static form with no `<script>` had inert checkboxes** — they tick
in every real browser. Event *dispatch* needs JS; the toggle does not, and the two are now separate.
With no JS there is nothing to call `preventDefault()`, so activation always proceeds.

This surfaced only because the gate deliberately included a *control that must still work*
(`#live`, in an enabled fieldset) alongside the ones that must not. Without that positive case, an
implementation that made everything inert would have passed every other assertion.

Gated by `g_disabled_inert`: a disabled checkbox does not tick, directly or via its label; a control
inside `<fieldset disabled>` does not tick, directly or via its label; a control in a normal fieldset
still does; and exactly two nodes report `disabled` in the a11y tree. Proven RED by skipping the
disabled check — the disabled box ticks.

## Clicking "Sign in" submits the form (tick 211)

`element.click()` on a submit button fired a click event and stopped — nothing was queued, so the
form never submitted. **"Click Sign in" is the single most common thing an agent is asked to do**, and
it silently did nothing: the agent clicks, sees no navigation, and cannot distinguish "the button is
broken" from "we never submitted".

A submit-button click now pushes its form onto `Page::pending_submits`, which
`take_form_submits()` drains into the **`requested`** list the shell already services.

**`requested`, not `direct`, and that is the load-bearing choice.** `requested` fires the `submit`
event first, so the page's validation handler runs and can cancel — and a click-to-submit is exactly
the case pages validate. Queueing it as `direct` would skip every client-side validator on the web.

Details that decide whether real pages work:

- **A bare `<button>` inside a form defaults to `type=submit`.** That default is the classic source
  of "why did my page reload", and not honouring it means `Sign in` does nothing.
- **`type=button` and `type=reset` do not submit** — every toggle and menu built from a `<button>`
  would otherwise reload the page.
- **`form="id"` associates a button with a form it is not inside**, and wins over the ancestor.
- A **disabled** submit button submits nothing (tick 210's rule, applied here).
- The queue is a **drain**, so the host cannot submit the same form twice.

Gated by `g_submit_click`, covering each of those. Proven RED by not queueing — the form never
submits.

Residue: `formaction`/`formmethod`/`formnovalidate` on the button are not carried to the submission,
and the submitter is not recorded (so a form with two submit buttons cannot tell which one was used —
`<button name=action value=delete>` is a real pattern). Link navigation from `element.click()` is
still not wired.

## The submitter reaches the server — "Save" vs "Delete" (tick 212)

A submit button contributes its `name=value` to the submission **only when it is the control that
activated the form**, which is why the field walk skips every button. `agent/src/forms.rs` said so in
a comment: *"Buttons only submit their own value when they are the activating control; we do not
model that, so they are skipped."* This models it.

**The failure it closes is a silent wrong-action bug, not a missing field.**
`<button name="action" value="delete">` beside `<button name="action" value="save">` is how a great
many forms say what the user asked for. Without the submitter both buttons post a **byte-identical
body** — the server cannot tell the destructive action from the safe one, and an agent driving the
page has no way to detect it.

Threaded end to end: `Page::pending_submits` records `(form, submitter)` on click →
`take_form_submits()` yields `Vec<(NodeId, Option<NodeId>)>` → `gui.rs::navigate_form_with` →
`forms::urlencoded_submission_with_submitter` → `fields_with_submitter`.

- **`None` is the honest answer for a script's `requestSubmit()`** — it has no submitter unless one
  is passed (which is not modelled yet), so nothing is guessed.
- **The submitter goes LAST** in the entry list, matching the order a browser builds it.
- **A button with no `name` is not a successful control** and contributes nothing — its `value` must
  not be smuggled in under another key.
- A button that was **not** clicked still never appears.

Gated in `agent/src/forms.rs` (`the_clicked_button_contributes_its_name_and_value`): Save and Delete
must produce **different** bodies; the nameless button contributes nothing; and the submitter reaches
the **POST body**, not just the field list — the wire is what the server reads. Proven RED by
ignoring the submitter — Save and Delete collapse to the same body.

Residue: `formaction`/`formmethod`/`formnovalidate` on the button still do not override the form's,
and `requestSubmit(submitter)` does not carry its argument.

## Cross-window messaging: `e.origin` is the security boundary (tick 231)

A receiver of a `postMessage` has **no other way** to learn who sent it. Every popup-login SDK — Google
Identity Services, Stripe Checkout, Auth0 `loginWithPopup` — guards with
`if (e.origin !== PROVIDER) return;`. So the value in that slot is not a reporting detail, it is the
whole boundary.

Until tick 231 it carried the sender's own **`targetOrigin` argument**, which is caller-supplied. Any
page that could reach the window could therefore forge its identity by writing
`postMessage(payload, PROVIDER)` — the guard compares the attacker's string against itself and
passes. `e.origin` is now the sender's document origin.

`targetOrigin` is a delivery **restriction** (deliver only if the receiver's origin matches) and is
still not enforced. It never was; it was only misreported. Recorded as residue rather than dropped
silently.

## Window identity must be seeded BEFORE a document's scripts run

`Page::set_identity` operates on a finished `PageContext` — i.e. after `load_document` has already
executed every render-blocking script. That is too late for the case it exists to serve: a popup's
login script reads `window.opener` **at load time** to post its token back. With late seeding it
reads `null`, posts nothing, and the opener spins forever with nothing thrown.

The shell had a comment asserting identity resolved "before any load-time script posts a message"
while calling `set_identity` after the build — intent and ordering disagreed, which is the kind of
gap only an end-to-end gate finds. Use `Page::load_with_identity` (or `manuk_page::set_pending_identity`
before constructing the page); the identity is applied during prelude install, ahead of any script.

## Two live pages in one process

`g_oauth_popup` is the first gate to drive two `Page`s at once and route messages between them the way
`gui.rs` does. The shell has always held many pages; nothing had proven they could talk.

## Clicking into a frame: by point, not by node (tick 233)

The host hit-tests the parent document and gets the `<iframe>` **element**. Dispatching a click on
that fires a click on the frame *box* — not on whatever the user pressed inside it. So a frame could
render and re-render correctly (tick 232) and still be impossible to operate, which is the whole
point of the content the web puts in frames: 3-D Secure "approve", embedded OAuth "allow", a payment
form's "pay".

`Page::dispatch_click_at(doc_x, doc_y, …)` clicks by **point**. When the point lands on a frame with a
live document, it translates into the child's coordinate space and hit-tests there — at the
**frame's** width, because that is the width the child laid out at; hit-testing at the window's width
tests against a layout the child never had. It recurses for nested frames.

### A dirty-bit guard cannot see a child's own script round

This is the subtle half. `repaint_child_frames` skips frames whose DOM is clean — correct when the
*parent's* script reached in and mutated the child. But a click routed INTO a frame makes the child
run its own script round, and that round re-cascades, re-lays-out and **clears the child's dirty
bits**. By the time the parent looks, the child is clean, so the guard skips precisely the frame that
just changed: the handler ran, the child's DOM said `approved`, and the screen still said `pending`.

Hence `repaint_frame(…, force: true)` on the click path. The click is the signal; there is nothing
left to detect afterwards. `force` here is a correctness requirement, not a performance shortcut.

### Body background does not reach the frame's canvas

Recorded because it cost a debugging detour: mutating `document.body.style.background` in a child
does **not** change the frame's bitmap. A box *inside* the frame's viewport does. The canvas-background
propagation from the root/body element is unimplemented — an independent gap, and one that makes
`body { background }` a poor thing to assert a repaint with.

## File upload: the interaction with no door, and the encoder nobody fed (tick 247)

`Page::set_input_files(node, &[(name, mime, contents)], …)` is the actuation entry for
`<input type=file>` — `G_FILE_INPUT`. It stores the selection, sets `value`, and fires **`input`
then `change`**, in that order, as a real picker does.

**Why it needed an entry point at all.** Every other interaction has a scriptable analogue: a click
is an event, typing is an event. **Choosing a file is not** — the bytes arrive through a native OS
picker dialog with no scriptable surface. So avatar, attachment, document and photo flows were not
*broken*, they were **unreachable**, and no capability probe reports a missing door.

### The bytes were dropped one layer ABOVE the code that knew how to send them

`manuk-net::multipart` is real, tested and correct, and had **never once been handed a file.**
`new FormData(form)` harvested `e.value` for every control including `type=file` — and the spec makes
a file input's `value` the deliberately-useless `C:\fakepath\a.txt`, so the field was submitted as
that literal string.

**This is a silent corruption, not an absence, and the distinction decides how you gate it.** The
page can see the file perfectly — `files.length`, `name`, `size`, `type` all read correct — while the
server receives `"C:\fakepath\a.txt"` where a JPEG should be. The RED probe proves the separation:
restoring the `value` harvest flips **the multipart claim alone** and leaves every page-visible claim
green. **An upload that succeeds and delivers garbage is worse than one that fails**, so "the page can
see the file" is not the property worth asserting — *"the bytes reached the wire"* is.

`C:\fakepath\` is spec, not whimsy: the real path is withheld (it leaks the user's directory layout),
and that exact prefix is mandated because sites had already been written to parse a Windows path out
of `value`. Returning a bare filename broke them.

### Installing a getter with no `Element` binding to hang it on

There is no `globalThis.Element` in this prelude — the chain
(instance → `HTMLElement.prototype` → `Element.prototype` → `Node.prototype`) is built in Rust and is
real, but **unnamed in JS**. `Object.getPrototypeOf(document.createElement('input'))` is the live
link, so a getter defined on it is inherited by every element that already exists *and* every one
created later. Per-instance definition would have missed both. **The general move: when the prototype
is real but unnamed, fetch it from a probe instance rather than adding a binding.**

`files` returns **`null`** on a non-file control, not an empty list — pages branch on
`input.files === null` to tell a text field from a file field, so an empty `FileList` would answer
"a file input with nothing chosen" about an `<input type=text>`.

### The fourth dead-end wire in six ticks

242 (quirks verdict), 243 (index key), 246 (focus), and now the multipart encoder. Same shape every
time: **the engine holds the right answer and throws it away at the last hop**, invisible to any probe
because the feature appears present at every layer anyone inspects. The tick-246 audit shape — *grep
for values computed with exactly one reader, or none* — extends here to **capabilities with no
producer**: a correct, tested encoder that nothing ever calls with real input.

## The dropzone: a handler that threw, and an opt-in that looks like ceremony (tick 248)

`Page::dispatch_drop(node, files, …)` fires `dragenter`, `dragover`, `drop` with one shared, real
`DataTransfer` — `G_DROP_UPLOAD`. It is the second half of the upload story begun at tick 247, and on
the modern web it is the *more* common half.

**The inert `DataTransfer` did not make drops a no-op — it made drop handlers THROW.**
`e.dataTransfer.files` is the first line of essentially every dropzone, and `undefined.files` is a
TypeError *inside* the handler. A page that throws there falls back to nothing: the dashed rectangle
stays lit and the upload never starts. **"Feature absent" and "handler throws" are different failure
classes**, and the second is the one that leaves the UI in a lying state.

### Why the whole sequence, not just the interesting event

The HTML drag protocol makes a page **opt in** to being a drop target: **a dropzone that does not
`preventDefault()` its `dragover` never receives a `drop`.** So dispatching `drop` alone would test a
path *no real browser can reach*, and would skip the `dragenter`/`dragover` handlers that set the
"drag active" styling — silently omitting the visible half of the interaction. The `DataTransfer` is
shared across all three because a dropzone that stashes it on `dragenter` must find the same object
on `drop`.

The return value carries the page's `preventDefault()` verdict and the host must honour it: a browser
that performs its default action after the dropzone accepted the drop **navigates to the dropped
file**, replacing the page the user was uploading to. That is the classic "my app vanished when I
missed the drop target" bug.

`types` must contain the literal token `Files`. `types.indexOf('Files') >= 0` is the standard
file-drag-vs-text-drag test, and a dropzone that gets it wrong takes the text branch and never looks
at `files` at all.

### A gate over a sequential handler chain has coarser resolution

Both RED probes here (fire only `drop`; build `types` as `[]`) go red at the **same** claim, `enter:`
— including the one predicted to isolate `types:`. The dropzone's handlers run in order, so **the
first bad read masks every later claim.** Contrast tick 247's multipart probe, which flipped exactly
one claim because the claims there were independent. Worth carrying when designing a gate: **claims
asserted inside a sequential chain cannot pinpoint; claims asserted over independent surfaces can.**

## Mouse actuation (tick 251): the sequence, the verdict, and a ledger that was wrong about itself

Two dispatchers landed — `Page::dispatch_dblclick` and `Page::dispatch_contextmenu` — but the more
durable finding is *how they were chosen*.

### The ledger nominated a phantom as its own top priority

`DAILY-DRIVER-EDGES.md` §1c listed **A11y node STATES** as *"missing (verified)"* and, in the same
cell, **"Highest-leverage agentic fix"**. It was already built: `A11yNode.state: A11yState`, with a
tri-state `Checked`, gated by `g_a11y_state.rs`. Two more rows (`file-input actuation`,
`drag-and-drop`) were falsified by ticks 247 and 248 — *three ticks earlier in the same session*. A
fourth (`hover/dblclick/contextmenu`) was half-stale: hover landed at t245.

**The checklist goes stale fastest from our own landed ticks**, which is the least intuitive
direction and the reason process rule 2 exists. Re-probing cost minutes; building the phantom would
have cost a tick and produced nothing. This is the seventh time the ledger has been wrong about its
top item.

The genuinely-missing hole was the one *next to* the phantom, and only visible once the phantoms
were cleared: `dblclick` and `contextmenu` had **zero hits across the whole engine**.

### A double-click is a sequence, not an event

Firing `dblclick` alone would have been the third half-fix of the week. A real double-click is
`click` (detail 1) → `click` (detail 2) → `dblclick` (detail 2), and **`event.detail` is the click
count**. `if (e.detail === 2)` on an ordinary `click` listener is the idiomatic double-click handler
— used precisely because it needs no second listener.

The first implementation dispatched both clicks correctly and **carried no `detail` at all**, because
`dispatch_click` routed through the bare-type `dispatch_event`. The gate caught it: `clicks=2 dbl=1`
— every handler running, sequence perfect — with `details=` empty and the `detail === 2` branch
unreachable forever. The fix threads a click count through `dispatch_click_detail`, so
label-forwarding and activation still behave exactly as for a single click.

Confirmed by RED probe, and the two failures are instructively different:
- **dblclick alone** → `clicks=0 dbl=1`. The notification arrives; the interaction never happened.
- **`detail: 0`** → `clicks=2 details=0,0`. Every listener runs and the branch is dead.

### A right-click's return value IS the capability

`contextmenu` is cancelable, and cancelling it is how every custom right-click menu on the web works.
So `dispatch_contextmenu` returns the page's verdict, and a browser ignoring a `false` would draw its
native menu on top of the page's own. Same shape as tick 248's drop verdict. `button: 2` is passed
explicitly (menu code guards on it), and `buttons` is computed rather than aliased — it is a
**bitmask**, so the right button is index 2 but bit 4. They coincide for no button and differ for the
middle one, which is exactly the kind of coincidence that hides a bug.

### A harness Bar-0 that was not an engine Bar-0

The four-test version of this gate **SIGSEGV'd**, while each test passed in isolation. A
`PageContext` is per-process here, so a second `Page::load` in one test binary races the first one's
runtime. Every JS-driving gate in `engine/page/tests/` is a single `#[test]` for this reason — a
convention that was load-bearing and undocumented. The crash signature is Bar-0-shaped and the cause
is entirely the test harness; **reading it as an engine regression would have sent the next tick into
the wrong organ.**

A related trap on the way: `eval_for_test` silently does nothing on a page with **no `<script>`**,
because no JS context is created. Activation itself does not need JS (`dispatch_click` says so), so
the checkbox assertions observe through the **a11y tree** instead — which is also how a real agent
confirms its own action, and doubles as proof the `A11yState` row above is no longer a phantom.

## The pointer sequence (tick 252): the menu that opens on mousedown

Tick 251 established a double-click is a sequence. One layer down the same was true and worse:
`mousedown`, `mouseup` and `pointerdown` were dispatched **nowhere in the engine**.

A large class of real UI never listens for `click`. Dropdown menus, comboboxes, drag handles,
sliders and press-and-hold controls open on `mousedown` — deliberately, so the menu is up before the
button comes back up. All of it was inert, silently.

### `buttons` is a mask, `button` is an index, and they coincide enough to hide the bug

`button` is which button (primary 0, right 2). `buttons` is a bitmask of what is **currently held**
(primary 1, right 4). Two consequences that a single derived value gets wrong:

- On **`mouseup` the mask is 0** — the press is over. Deriving `buttons` from `button` reports a
  button still held after release.
- The derived form happens to be *correct* for `click` and `contextmenu`, which is exactly why the
  refactor to "just compute it once" is tempting and wrong.

### A label presses down once, on the element under the pointer

`<label>` forwarding re-enters `dispatch_click_inner`, not the outer entry point. A real browser
fires the pointer pair on the element the pointer is actually over and forwards only the *click* to
the labelled control. Re-entering at the top gives the control a press it never received — confirmed
by RED probe (`controlDowns=1`). This is why the change is a function split rather than three lines.

### `preventDefault()` on mousedown is not a click-cancel

It suppresses focus and text selection. Every toolbar button in every rich editor relies on this: it
prevents `mousedown` to keep the document selection alive, and still expects its `click`. Honouring
that verdict as a cancel made the click vanish (`seq=down>up`) — a breakage that would have looked
like "the editor's buttons stopped working" with no error anywhere.

Residue: no Pointer Events (`pointerdown`/`pointerup`/`pointermove`), which modern drag libraries
increasingly prefer; no `mousemove`, so drag *gestures* are still unreachable. This is the press,
not the drag.

## The select that submitted correctly and read as empty (tick 253)

`select.value` was `""`, `selectedIndex` `undefined`, `options` `undefined` — for every `<select>` on
the web. `HTMLSelectElement` existed as an interface marker with nothing behind it.

**Why nobody noticed: form submission was right.** Submission reads the DOM directly and had been
correct since t163-167. So the field submitted the right value while any script branching on
`select.value` got an empty string. **Two paths to the same question, one right, one silent — and
pages only read the silent one.**

### "Nothing selected" vs "nothing selected yet"

The one assertion that failed on first run, and the real content of the tick. `select.value = "x"`
where no option has value `x` must land on **index -1**. An untouched single-select must report
**index 0** — that is what the browser shows and what the form submits. Both states have *no option
marked*, so the `selected` content attributes cannot distinguish them.

The spec models selectedness as a per-option bit **separate from** the content attribute, precisely
for this. Deriving both from the same absence yields one of the two answers and is silently wrong
about the other — and which one you get depends on which case you happened to test.

### Two more traps, both confirmed by probe

- **An option's value falls back to its TEXT.** `<option>Blue</option>` submits and reports `"Blue"`.
  Dropping the fallback reports `""` for every unvalued option, and a great many real selects are
  written that way.
- **`<optgroup>` options still belong to the select.** A children-only walk reports a grouped select
  as having *zero* options — it reads as entirely empty rather than merely wrong.

### `input` then `change` — and React only hears the first

`Page::select_option` fires both, in that order. **React's `onChange` is really the `input` event.**
A host firing only `change` leaves every React select unchanged while vanilla pages keep working,
which presents as "it works on some sites" and is miserable to diagnose. Firing only `input` fails
the mirror image.

Residue: `data-manuk-noselection` is visible to `getAttribute`/`outerHTML` (same shape as t247's
`data-manuk-files`) — real selectedness needs per-element state the arena does not carry.
`select.options`/`selectedOptions` are still absent, so `s.options[i]` throws; a live
`HTMLOptionsCollection` is its own tick.

## `s.options[i]` (tick 254): when the empty answer throws too

`select.options` did not exist, so `s.options.length` was a TypeError and the script died there. The
usual consolation — "at least it reads as empty" — **does not apply here**, and the RED probe proved
it: a `selectedOptions` that correctly reports 0 for an untouched select makes the page throw on
`selectedOptions[0]`. The empty answer cascades into the same TypeError class.

That is worth stating generally: **for a collection, "reports nothing" and "throws" are often the
same bug one line apart**, because the caller's next move is to index it.

### The divergence class, reproduced by me in a day

`option.value` read the raw `value` attribute, while `select.value` used a helper that falls back to
the option's text. So `<option>Blue</option>` reported `"Blue"` via `s.value` and `""` via
`s.options[2].value` — **the same fact, two readers, disagreeing.** Tick 253's entire finding was
that form-submission and `select.value` disagreed; one layer down I built the identical shape. The
lesson is not "be careful" — it is that **any fact with a fallback rule needs exactly one function
computing it**, and both callers must route through it.

### `option.index` counts across optgroups

It is the position within the **owning select**, not within the immediate parent. A
child-index-within-parent answer makes the second `<optgroup>` restart at 0, so code keying on
`index` addresses the wrong option in every group but the first — confirmed by probe (`gIdx=0,1,0`).

Residue: these are **snapshot Arrays**, not live `HTMLOptionsCollection`s. Indexing and `length`
work; `item()`, `namedItem()`, `add()`/`remove()` do not exist, and a collection captured before a
mutation will not reflect it.

## Scroll snap — the carousel stops on a slide (tick 266)

`scroll-snap-type` on a scroll container plus `scroll-snap-align` on its children is what every paged
feed, story tray, gallery and mobile card row is built from. Measured absent by
`g_probe_capabilities` (`scrollsnap: no`); now gated by `G_SCROLL_SNAP` and pinned in that probe's
ratchet list.

### One transformation at one chokepoint

`Page::set_element_scroll` was already the single place a container's offset is decided — it clamps
the requested position to what there is to scroll and translates the subtree by the delta. Snapping
is therefore not a scrolling subsystem, it is one function inserted at that point:

```
let clamped = (left.clamp(0.0, max_x), top.clamp(0.0, max_y));
let new = self.snap_scroll(node, clamped, (max_x, max_y));
```

**The ordering against the clamp is the entire correctness question.** Snap first and a candidate
beyond the scrollable range gets chosen, then clamped back to an unaligned offset — so the container
**can never reach its own last slide.** That is the classic carousel bug: it is invisible unless a
test scrolls all the way to the end, and it presents as a content problem rather than a scrolling one.

### Three decisions

**Candidates come from the container's own subtree.** `container.walk(...)` rather than a
document-wide scan, so one carousel cannot snap to another carousel's slide.

**An empty candidate set must leave the offset alone.** A container declaring `scroll-snap-type` with
no aligned children has nothing to snap to, and "the nearest of nothing" degrades to pinning it at
zero — a declared-but-unused property turning into a scroller that cannot scroll. This is carried by
`nearest()` returning its own input when the candidate list is empty, and **that line is the feature**
— an explicit `!is_empty()` guard in front of it was dead code (see below).

**`mandatory` vs `proximity` is deliberately not modelled.** `proximity` lets the UA decide, and
"snap to the nearest point" is conforming for both. Modelling the axis decides whether a carousel
lands on a slide; modelling the strictness would only change *how often*, and picking a proximity
threshold would be inventing behaviour rather than implementing it.

### Property plumbing: recovered from MinimalCascade

`scroll-snap-type`/`scroll-snap-align` parse in `MinimalCascade` and are copied into the Stylo path
in `stylo_engine`, exactly as `text-overflow` and `overflow-wrap` already are — Stylo's servo build
models them as typed values we do not consume, and the shipping path needs plain keywords. They also
serialise back through `getComputedStyle` in both camelCase and `getPropertyValue` form, because a
carousel library reads `scrollSnapType` to decide whether to run its own polyfill.

### The probe that came back green

Four RED probes were run and **one passed** — removing the `!ys.is_empty()` guard changed nothing,
because `nearest()` already returns its input on an empty set. The guard was **dead code sitting in
front of the line that actually does the work**, so the assertion aimed at it could not fail. It was
deleted and the real failure shape probed instead (`unwrap_or(0.0)`, pinning the container at the
top), which fires. Sixth vacuous-assertion catch in six ticks, and the generalisation past assertions
is: **a redundant guard hides which line is load-bearing, so the probe aims at the wrong one.**

### Residue — the bigger half is still open

**Only the vertical axis works, and the gate says so by only testing that axis.** A horizontal one
could not be gated: an inline-block row yields no horizontal scroll range in layout today (`max_x`
comes back `0`), so `overflow-x: scroll` does not scroll at all. That is a pre-existing
**scroll-geometry** gap rather than a snap gap — the snap code handles `x` symmetrically and is
simply unexercised there — but the practical consequence is that **horizontal carousels, the
commonest kind, still do not scroll.** Fixing `scrollWidth` for inline rows is the next lever here.

## Horizontal rows: `white-space: nowrap` around atomic inlines (tick 267)

The residue above named the wrong organ, and a probe said so before a line was written. The claim was
a **scroll-geometry** gap — "an inline-block row yields no horizontal scroll range". Measuring four
container shapes instead of theorising from one failing case:

| shape | scrollWidth | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `display:flex` row, `flex-shrink:0` | 500 | **already correct** |
| single wide block child (`width:500px`) | 500 | **already correct** |
| `inline-block` row, no `nowrap` | 200 | correct — it *should* wrap |
| `inline-block` row + `white-space:nowrap` | 200 | **the bug** |
| plain text + `nowrap` (control) | 490 | `nowrap` already worked for text |

So horizontal scroll geometry was never broken. `nowrap` was broken **for exactly one token type**.

### The mechanism

An inline formatting context is a run of tokens; `InlineItem::Word` and `InlineItem::Atomic` (an
`inline-block` / `inline-flex` / `inline-grid`) are both tokens in it, and the line breaker's rule is

```rust
let breakable = !(no_wrap && prev_no_wrap);
```

— a break opportunity belongs to *both* sides, so it is suppressed only when both are `nowrap`. The
`Word` arm read `white-space` off the text node's inherited style. The `Atomic` arm passed a
**hardcoded `false`**. One literal, and every atomic inline permanently advertised itself as a legal
break point, so `no_wrap && prev_no_wrap` could never hold across a row of them.

The fix carries `no_wrap` on `InlineItem::Atomic`, read from the atomic's own computed style at
collection time — `white-space` is *inherited*, so the container's `nowrap` is already sitting on the
child, the same source the `Word` path uses. Nav bars, tab strips, chip rows, breadcrumbs, toolbars
and carousels are all this shape.

### The failure was not "it doesn't scroll"

It was that the row **silently wrapped into a stack** — five 100px tabs in a 200px bar became three
rows, the bar grew to 3× its declared height and shoved the page down, and then `scrollWidth ==
clientWidth` so nothing scrolled *because, given the wrapped layout, there was correctly nothing to
scroll*. The engine was **self-consistent and wrong**, which is why no capability count could see it
and why the symptom pointed at scroll geometry rather than at line breaking. Same lesson as
[[symptom-names-wrong-organ]]: measure the boxes before theorising from the visible end of the chain.

### What this unblocked for free

Tick 266 wrote the x-axis of `snap_scroll` and **could never run it** — there was no horizontal
scroll range in the engine to run it against, so it was asserted correct by symmetry alone. With the
range present it is now gated: `x=120` lands on 100, `x=270` snaps to the nearest point (300, not
back to 0), and `x=9999` reaches the last tab rather than clamping to an unaligned offset.

### The control is the load-bearing assertion

`#wrap` — the identical row *without* `nowrap` — must **still wrap**. That is what separates "honours
`white-space`" from "never breaks inline-blocks", and passing `no_wrap: true` unconditionally is a
real RED probe that only this assertion catches. A blanket disable would have turned every ordinary
`inline-block` gallery on the web into one infinite line while making the headline assertion greener.

---

## `visibility:hidden` must not be hit-testable (tick 272)

A closed dropdown was **swallowing clicks on the article underneath it**.

```css
.dropdown-content { position:absolute; visibility:hidden; width:max-content }
```

The modern web hides every dropdown, popover, menu and tooltip this way — `visibility:hidden` rather
than `display:none`, so the panel keeps its box and can be revealed without a reflow. It is
therefore **laid out at full size, permanently, on top of real content**. Chrome lays it out and
neither paints nor hit-tests it. We hit-tested it.

### Why the a11y tree is the right place to fix it

`A11yNode::hit_test` consults only the box, and `is_hidden` reads the `hidden` / `aria-hidden`
**attributes** — `visibility` is a *style*, and the a11y builder never saw the cascade at all. Per
WAI-ARIA a `visibility:hidden` element is **not exposed in the accessibility tree**, so pruning it
there is both spec-correct and fixes hit-testing for free, with no new concept in the hit-test path.

`visibility` is a *style*, so it cannot be derived from the DOM: the page, which holds the computed
styles, passes a `HashSet<NodeId>` of hidden nodes into `build_tree_with_visibility` — the same
shape the z-index map already uses for occlusion awareness.

### `visibility` is the one hiding mechanism a descendant can UNDO

```html
<div style="visibility:hidden">          <!-- dropped from the tree -->
  <button>Menu item</button>             <!-- dropped -->
  <button style="visibility:visible">    <!-- SHOWN by Chrome — must survive -->
</div>
```

So the hidden node is dropped and **the walk continues into its children**. Writing `continue` (which
prunes the subtree) is the natural first implementation and it deletes the re-shown descendant; the
gate asserts this case explicitly so that implementation cannot pass. `display:none`,
`hidden` and `aria-hidden` are *not* undoable and still prune.

### How it was found

Not by looking for it. Tick 272's other change widened absolutely-positioned panels to their correct
`max-content` width, and G6 clickability fell from 98.9% to 97.9% — four more links with a hidden
Wikipedia menu on top of them. **The occlusion was always wrong; the panels had merely been too small
to cover much.** A gate on a metric nobody was aiming at is what surfaced it.

## `<input>`/`<textarea>` text selection — `setSelectionRange` / `select` (tick 302)

How a page positions the caret, selects a range, or "selects all on focus": `selectionStart` /
`selectionEnd` / `selectionDirection`, `setSelectionRange(start, end [, direction])`, and `select()`.
The whole surface was absent (`undefined` / `is not a function`), so an input mask, a copy-button that
`select()`s its field, or an editor that reads the caret position all broke.

The selection is stored per element in UTF-16 code units (a thread-local `NodeId → (start, end,
direction)` map): `setSelectionRange`/`select` write it (clamped so `start ≤ end ≤ value length`),
`selectionStart`/`selectionEnd` read it (defaulting to the end of the value when nothing has set a
selection), and `selectionDirection` reports `none`/`forward`/`backward`. `select()` covers the whole
value.

### The teeth `G_TEXT_SELECTION` uses

`select-all` (`select()` → `0..length`), `range` (`setSelectionRange(2,5)` reads back `2`/`5`),
`direction` (`'backward'` round-trips), `clamp` (offsets past the length clamp to it). A stub with
constant offsets fails; unregistering the accessors made the calls throw before landing.

**Honest limit:** this is the JS/IDL contract (a page can read and set the selection); the visual
highlight of the selected text is a rendering follow-on, and `setRangeText` (mutating the value through
the selection) is not yet wired. [[js-engine]]

## `setRangeText` — replace text through the selection (tick 303)

The write half of the tick-302 selection API: `input.setRangeText(replacement [, start, end,
selectMode])` splices text INTO the value — what autocomplete, "insert at cursor", and text editors
reach for. With no range it replaces the current selection; with `start`/`end`, a specific span. It was
absent (`is not a function`). It reuses the tick-302 selection store: read the value, splice the
replacement into `value[start..end]` (UTF-16 units), write it back, then land the selection per
`selectMode` — `select` (over the inserted text), `start`/`end` (collapse), or `preserve` (default —
keep the old selection, shifted by the length delta).

### The teeth `G_SET_RANGE_TEXT` uses

`replace-selection` (`setSelectionRange(0,5); setRangeText('HI')` → `HI world`), `range` (explicit span),
`select-mode` (`'select'` selects the inserted text), `insert` (empty-range insert at the caret). A stub
cannot fake the resulting value. Unregistering the method made the call throw. [[js-engine]]

## `document.startViewTransition` — the transition-wrapped update must run (tick 308)

View Transitions are how a growing share of SPAs (and MPAs, via the CSS half) apply a route/state
change: rather than mutate the DOM directly, the app hands the mutation to the browser inside a
callback — `document.startViewTransition(() => this.render(next))` — so the browser can snapshot
before/after and cross-fade. It is interoperable now, so Next.js/SvelteKit/Astro and hand-rolled apps
reach for it.

### The failure without it is silent and total

The method was absent (`g_probe_capabilities` measured `viewtransitions:no`). A call therefore threw
`startViewTransition is not a function`, the TypeError propagated out of the click handler, and **the
DOM update wrapped in the callback never ran** — the page froze on the previous view with no error the
user could see. A capability check that renders the page cannot tell a working transition from a dead
one; only driving the click and reading the resulting DOM can.

### The honest implementation is the spec's own skip path

This engine does not composite snapshot pseudo-elements, so there is no cross-fade to play. That is
precisely the spec's skip path: a document that cannot animate (reduced-motion, not visible) still
*invokes the callback, lands its mutations, and settles the promises* — it just omits the animation.
So the shim (in the `dom_bindings.rs` prelude, beside `createEvent`):

- runs the update callback **synchronously**, so its writes are in the DOM by the time the call
  returns (skipped, not deferred — which matches the visible outcome);
- returns a real `ViewTransition`: `ready`, `finished`, `updateCallbackDone` (thenables) and a
  `skipTransition()` method, `types` as a `Set` — the shape sites `await`;
- **propagates a callback error** to all three promises (a throwing update rejects, it is not
  swallowed into a false success), while each branch quietly absorbs its own rejection so a site that
  awaits only one does not surface an unhandled rejection from the others.

This is not a stub — the load-bearing behaviour (the update applies) is delivered. The honest limit is
that there is no cross-fade animation.

### The teeth `G_VIEW_TRANSITION` uses

`defined` (feature detect succeeds), `applied` (the callback ran and `#view` text changed), `shape`
(the three thenables + `skipTransition`), `errorpath` (a throwing callback surfaces via
`updateCallbackDone` rejecting), plus a **real engine-dispatched click** whose handler wraps its update
in a transition and must still change the view — the frozen-page half a load-time script cannot
self-report. RED: deleting the shim drops `defined`/`applied`/`shape`/click together.

## `window.navigation` — the Navigation API intercepts SPA routing (tick 309)

The Navigation API is the modern successor to the `history.pushState` + `popstate` + link-click
interception dance every SPA router used to hand-roll. Instead of monkey-patching clicks and
reconstructing state from the History API, the router listens for one `navigate` event — which fires
for every same-document navigation — and calls `event.intercept({ handler })` to take it over. Newer
frameworks feature-detect `window.navigation` and prefer it.

### The failure without it is a silent dead router

`window.navigation` was absent (`g_probe_capabilities` measured `navigationapi:no`; `history_bindings.rs`
called it out of scope). A router doing
`navigation.addEventListener('navigate', e => e.intercept({ handler: () => render(e.destination.url) }))`
found `navigation` undefined and either threw or bound nothing — so every in-app link performed a full
document load or did nothing, with no error the user could see. The app simply stopped behaving like an
app.

### Implemented as a shim OVER the proven History/Location plumbing

The shim (in the `dom_bindings.rs` prelude, beside `startViewTransition`) does not introduce a second
source of URL truth. `navigate(url, opts)`:

- dispatches a real `NavigateEvent` — `destination.url`, `canIntercept`, `navigationType`,
  `intercept({ handler })`, `preventDefault()`, plus the legacy `transitionWhile` alias;
- if not vetoed, **commits through `history.pushState` / `replaceState`**, so `location`, the omnibox,
  the back/forward stack and `popstate` all stay in lockstep with the app's idea of the URL;
- runs the router's `intercept()` handlers — the client-side route change. They execute in a microtask
  (per spec async); the engine drains microtasks at end of load, so a handler's DOM writes land.

`g.history` / `g.location` are read at CALL time, so the shim does not depend on prelude ordering. Also
provided: `currentEntry` / `entries()` / `canGoBack` / `canGoForward`, `back` / `forward` / `traverseTo`
/ `reload` / `updateCurrentEntry`, and the `currententrychange` / `navigatesuccess` / `navigateerror`
events. The honest limit: `signal`/abort and cross-document navigations are not modelled — same-document
routing, which is the whole point of the API, is.

### The teeth `G_NAVIGATION_API` uses

`exists` / `entryurl`, `fired` / `dest` / `canintercept` / `navtype` (the navigate event fires with a
correct destination), `result` (the `{committed, finished}` thenables), `committed` (`location` and
`currentEntry` advanced together through the shared plumbing), `vetoed` (`preventDefault()` aborts and
the URL does not move), and — the load-bearing one a synchronous script cannot self-report — the
`intercept({handler})` handler RAN and applied the route change, observed as a DOM mutation after the
microtask drain. RED: disabling the shim drops every claim at once.

## `element.animate` — the Web Animations API fast-forwards to its end state (tick 310)

The Web Animations API — `element.animate(keyframes, options)` — is the imperative animation primitive
the web uses constantly: fade/slide/scale on interaction, list reordering, toast in and out, focus
transitions. It is far more common than the declarative View Transitions API (tick 308), and it was
absent everywhere (0 references in the engine).

### The failure without it is a dead interaction

`element.animate is not a function` throws out of a click or mount callback and takes the whole
interaction with it — the same silent-handler failure as a missing `startViewTransition`. And the
`await el.animate(...).finished` sequencing pattern hangs forever on a promise that never exists.

### No compositor timeline, so it fast-forwards — honestly

This engine has no compositor timeline and cannot render the in-between frames, and it does not pretend
to. The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`) runs the animation to its END STATE:

- normalizes both keyframe forms — the array `[{opacity:0},{opacity:1}]` and the object
  `{opacity:[0,1], transform:['none','scale(2)']}`;
- in a microtask, settles the `Animation` to `finished` — so `await el.animate(...).finished` resolves;
- when the fill mode persists the end state (`forwards`/`both`), applies the final keyframe's styles to
  inline style, where they flow into the computed style — the outcome most imperative animations exist
  to produce;
- exposes the surface libraries drive: `play`/`pause`/`reverse`/`finish`/`cancel`/`commitStyles`/
  `persist`/`updatePlaybackRate`, `playState`/`currentTime`/`effect`/`finished`/`ready`, `onfinish`/
  `oncancel`, and `Element.getAnimations()`. `cancel()` rejects `finished` with an `AbortError`.

The honest limit, stated plainly: no intermediate frames — the animation snaps to its end rather than
tweening.

### The install-site gotcha (the one that cost three probes)

The natural placement — guard on `g.Element.prototype` — silently no-ops: **there is no `Element`
binding this early in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`** (the `Element`/`HTMLElement` global constructors and the real
prototype chain are built later in Rust; the `g.HTMLElement` defined at prelude end is a *disconnected*
fresh constructor whose `.prototype` no instance inherits). The live chain link is
`Object.getPrototypeOf(document.createElement('div'))` — the exact idiom the `files` getter uses — and a
method defined on it is inherited by every element that exists now or is created later. Patching
`g.Element.prototype` (undefined here) or `g.HTMLElement.prototype` (disconnected) reaches nothing.

### The teeth `G_WEB_ANIMATIONS` uses

`defined` (callable, returns an Animation with the driven surface), `tracked` (`getAnimations` reports
it), `finishedresolved` (recorded from inside `.then`, so it proves the microtask fast-forward ran),
`endstate` (`fill:forwards` lands the final keyframe in `getComputedStyle().opacity`), `cancelrejected`
(`cancel()` → `finished` rejects `AbortError`). RED: disabling the shim drops them together.

## `navigator.geolocation` — honest denial, not a `TypeError` (tick 311)

The Geolocation API — `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error)` — is called directly
from a load or click handler by weather sites, store locators, delivery/ride apps and "near me" search.
It was absent.

### The failure without it is a dead handler

In a real browser `navigator.geolocation` is ALWAYS present, so this code does not feature-detect the
object. Its absence therefore does not degrade gracefully: `navigator.geolocation` is `undefined`,
`undefined.getCurrentPosition` throws a `TypeError`, and the throw takes the rest of that handler — and
often the page's boot — with it. The same silent-handler failure as a missing `element.animate`.

### No location provider, so it denies — self-consistently

We have no way to determine location, and we already model the geolocation PERMISSION as `'denied'`
(the `PERM_STATE` table behind `navigator.permissions.query`). The honest answer is therefore the one a
user who declines the prompt gives, delivered in the shape the API promises: fail ASYNCHRONOUSLY with a
`GeolocationPositionError` whose `code` is `PERMISSION_DENIED` (1). This is not a stub that pretends —
inventing coordinates would be the dishonest path — and it cannot contradict `permissions.query`, which
answers `'denied'` for the same feature one layer up. The site's error branch runs and it shows its
manual "enter your location" fallback instead of dying on an unguarded property access.

The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, right after the permissions block) provides `getCurrentPosition`,
`watchPosition` (returns a numeric id for `clearWatch`, and reports the denial once), `clearWatch`, the
`GeolocationPositionError` constructor with its constants on both the instance and the constructor, and
named `GeolocationPosition`/`GeolocationCoordinates` interfaces so `instanceof` checks do not throw.

### The teeth `G_GEOLOCATION` uses

`defined` (object + the three methods, and the call does not throw synchronously), `denied` (the error
callback fires with `code === 1 === err.PERMISSION_DENIED`, constants readable), `asyncorder` (the line
after `getCurrentPosition()` runs before the callback — delivery is asynchronous), `watchid`
(`watchPosition` returns a number), `permconsistent` (matches `permissions.query({name:'geolocation'})`
→ `'denied'`). RED: flipping the install guard to `false` throws `undefined.getCurrentPosition` and
drops `defined`/`denied`/`asyncorder` together.

## `navigator.mediaSession` — retained media control state, not an inert stub (tick 312)

The Media Session API is what every media site drives — YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Netflix, podcast
players and every `<audio>`-backed app — to expose track metadata and playback controls to the OS media
keys, the lock screen and headset buttons. It was absent.

### The failure without it is a dead player

Real player code assumes `navigator.mediaSession` is present and does NOT feature-detect it, so its
absence is a silent-handler failure: `navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler is not a function` (or
`undefined.setActionHandler`) throws out of the player's `init`, and the player is dead — the same
shape as a missing `element.animate` or `navigator.geolocation`.

### Retain everything; the OS wiring is the follow-on

The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, after the geolocation block) is REAL, not inert. It retains:

- `metadata` — set from `new MediaMetadata({title, artist, album, artwork})`; the constructor normalizes
  `artwork` to an array of `{src, sizes, type}` (sites read `.artwork[0].src` back), missing members are
  empty strings, never `undefined`;
- `playbackState` — `'none'|'paused'|'playing'`, round-tripped;
- `setPositionState({duration, position, playbackRate})` — retained for a scrubber;
- `setActionHandler(action, handler)` — validates the action enum (an out-of-enum action THROWS a
  TypeError; `null` unsets) and stores the handler.

We have no OS media-key surface to invoke those handlers from yet — that is a host integration, and it
is the honest limit. But because the state is retained and queryable, a host or agent can read
`navigator.mediaSession.metadata.title` to show "now playing" and actuate the player through a
non-standard `__invoke(action)` seam that runs the stored handler. Storing is the capability; the OS
wiring is the follow-on. That makes the shim an agentic-actuation win, not merely a no-throw stub.

### The teeth `G_MEDIA_SESSION` uses

`defined` (object + `MediaMetadata`, methods callable, no throw), `metadata` (title/artist round-trip
and `artwork[0].src` normalized), `playbackstate` (round-trips `'playing'`), `enumrejected` (a bad
action throws a `TypeError`), `handlerran` (a stored `play` handler runs via `__invoke`, proving it is
retained, not dropped), `handlerunset` (`null` removes it). RED: disabling the shim throws
`ReferenceError: MediaMetadata is not defined` and drops them together.

## `window.visualViewport` — the visual viewport equals the layout viewport (tick 313)

The VisualViewport API is read by keyboard-aware layouts, pinch-zoom handlers, sticky / `position:fixed`
correction and mobile-responsive frameworks: `visualViewport.width/height/scale/offsetTop` and
`visualViewport.addEventListener('resize'|'scroll', …)`. It was absent.

### The failure without it is a dead layout

The API is used UNGUARDED (`visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', …)`), so its absence is a
silent-handler failure: `visualViewport` is `undefined`, `undefined.addEventListener` (or
`undefined.width`) throws out of the layout setup, and the responsive/keyboard code dies.

### No zoom, so it mirrors the layout viewport

The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, after the `screen` block) exposes `width`/`height` as getters onto the
real `innerWidth`/`innerHeight` — the SAME viewport the cascade lays out against, so a later resize is
tracked and JS never disagrees with `@media` one layer up — with `scale` 1, `offsetLeft/Top` 0 and
`pageLeft/Top` from the scroll offset. It is a full EventTarget (`add`/`removeEventListener` retain and
remove listeners, `onresize`/`onscroll`).

Honest limit: with no live pinch-zoom or on-screen keyboard, `scale` stays 1 and the `resize`/`scroll`
events do not fire. The listeners are retained anyway — the unguarded wiring must not throw, and a
future host binding can drive them — the same posture as `matchMedia`'s listeners.

### The teeth `G_VISUAL_VIEWPORT` uses

`defined` (numeric metrics + EventTarget, no throw), `mirrors` (`width`/`height` EQUAL
`innerWidth`/`innerHeight`, `scale` 1, offsets 0 — proving it tracks the real viewport, not a constant),
`events` (unguarded `add`/`removeEventListener` does not throw and retains the listener). RED: disabling
the shim throws `TypeError: … vv is undefined` and drops `defined`/`mirrors` together.

## `navigator.connection` — honest adaptive-loading signals (tick 314)

The Network Information API is read by adaptive-loading code — Next.js `<Image>`, media players, PWAs,
`react-adaptive-hooks` — to choose image quality, autoplay and prefetch from
`navigator.connection.effectiveType` / `.saveData`. It was absent.

### The failure without it is a dead loader

Some adaptive code reaches for `navigator.connection.addEventListener('change', …)` (or
`.effectiveType`) unguarded, so its absence throws `undefined.addEventListener` out of the loader's
setup and the image/prefetch logic dies.

### Honest defaults, not a fabrication that costs the user

The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, after `userAgentData`) reports the posture a real browser gives on a fast
desktop connection: `effectiveType:'4g'`, `downlink:10`, `rtt:50`, `saveData:false` (plus `type` and a
`change` EventTarget). We do not continuously measure the link — but `saveData:false` is not a guess,
it is the TRUE state (no data-saver is enabled), and a good un-metered default is both honest and
non-harmful: a page told this loads full-quality assets, which is correct here. The dishonest path would
be a fabricated SLOW link, which would needlessly degrade every page.

### The teeth `G_NETWORK_INFO` uses

`defined` (the metrics + EventTarget, no throw), `signals` (`saveData` false, a valid ECT token,
`downlink > 0`, `rtt >= 0` — proving adaptive code takes the full-quality path), `events` (unguarded
`change` add/remove does not throw, retained). RED: disabling the shim throws
`TypeError: … c is undefined` and drops `defined`/`signals` together.

## `navigator.storage` — truthful quota and durable persistence (tick 315)

Offline-first apps and PWAs call `navigator.storage.estimate()` before caching to check headroom and
`navigator.storage.persist()` to keep their IndexedDB/Cache data from being evicted. Both are awaited in
the boot path, so an absent `navigator.storage` is `undefined` and `undefined.estimate()` throws out of
startup.

### A capability we HAVE, so the answers are truthful

Unlike geolocation (an honest denial), this is backed by a real per-origin IndexedDB + Cache store that,
on a single-user desktop, is durable and not evicted. So the shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, after
`navigator.connection`) answers truthfully:

- `estimate()` → `{quota: 10 GiB, usage: 0, usageDetails: {}}` — a generous, real quota;
- `persist()` → `true` and `persisted()` → `true` — persistence is genuinely granted, a true property
  of the backend, not a flattering guess.

Honest limits: `usage` is a FLOOR (the prelude cannot cheaply sum live per-store bytes; apps use it
against `quota`, which is the load-bearing number), and OPFS `getDirectory()` is deliberately NOT
stubbed — a present-but-broken `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` is worse than an honest absence a feature
check can see.

### The teeth `G_STORAGE_MANAGER` uses

`defined` (estimate/persist/persisted callable, no throw), `estimated` (`estimate()` resolves
`{quota>0, usage<=quota}`), `persisted` (`persist()` and `persisted()` both resolve `true`). RED:
disabling the shim throws `TypeError: … st is undefined` and drops `defined`/`estimated` together.

## `speechSynthesis` — present, but honestly mute (tick 316)

Screen readers, accessibility "read aloud" buttons, language-learning apps and reader-mode UIs construct
`new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text)` and call `speechSynthesis.speak/getVoices/cancel`, often UNGUARDED.
Absent, `SpeechSynthesisUtterance is not defined` (or `undefined.getVoices()`) throws out of the a11y
handler.

### No TTS engine, so it reports "cannot speak" — it does not pretend

We ship no text-to-speech engine, so — like geolocation — the shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, after
`navigator.storage`) makes the API PRESENT with a truthful failure rather than a pretense:

- `getVoices()` → `[]` (true: no voices are installed);
- `speak(utterance)` reports failure ASYNCHRONOUSLY through the utterance's `error` event
  (`error: 'synthesis-unavailable'`) and NEVER fires `end`. A fired `end` would tell the app it spoke
  when the user heard nothing — a lie the code cannot see. Code that handles `onerror` degrades
  correctly (shows the text, offers a download); the API being present is what stops the unguarded throw.

`SpeechSynthesisUtterance` carries the full author surface (`text`/`lang`/`voice`/`volume`/`rate`/
`pitch` + an EventTarget), so setup code runs unchanged.

### The teeth `G_SPEECH_SYNTHESIS` uses

`defined` (`speechSynthesis` + `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, methods callable, no throw), `novoices`
(`getVoices()` → empty array), `erroredhonest` (`speak()` fires `error` 'synthesis-unavailable' and NOT
`end`). RED: disabling the shim throws `ReferenceError: speechSynthesis is not defined` and drops
`defined`/`erroredhonest` together.

## `navigator.wakeLock` — grant a real sentinel, OS enforcement is the follow-on (tick 317)

Video players (YouTube et al.), presentation/slides apps, recipe and reading UIs, kiosks and dashboards
`await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')` to keep the display awake, and hold the returned sentinel.
The request is awaited in the play/present handler, so an absent `navigator.wakeLock` is `undefined` and
`undefined.request(...)` throws out of that handler.

### Host owns the sleep timer, so grant and retain — do not reject

The display's sleep behaviour is host/OS-owned, so — like `mediaSession` — the shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`,
after `speechSynthesis`) GRANTS and retains a real `WakeLockSentinel` (`type`, `released`, a `release()`
that resolves, flips `released` and fires the `release` event, plus `add`/`removeEventListener`) rather
than rejecting. Granting is the capability the player needs to proceed and hold a working handle; a
future host binding can enforce the actual OS inhibit. The honest limit: the OS sleep timer is not yet
driven. Rejecting instead would needlessly send every video into its "could not keep screen awake"
branch.

### The teeth `G_WAKE_LOCK` uses

`defined` (`request` callable, no sync throw), `promise` (`request` returns a thenable), `granted`
(resolves a sentinel with `type:'screen'`, `released:false`, a `release()` method), `released`
(`release()` resolves, flips `released` true, fires `release`). RED: disabling the shim throws
`TypeError: … navigator.wakeLock is undefined` and drops `defined`/`granted` together.

## `attachInternals()` — form-associated custom elements upgrade (tick 318)

Web-component design systems (Lit/Shoelace-style controls, GitHub's own components, Salesforce
Lightning, any `static formAssociated = true` custom input) call `this.attachInternals()` in their
CONSTRUCTOR to get the `ElementInternals` that submits their value, reports validity, exposes `:state()`
and reflects ARIA. It is not feature-detected, so its absence throws `attachInternals is not a function`
out of the constructor and the entire component fails to upgrade — it renders as an empty, dead tag.

### A real internals that retains state, on the live element prototype

The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, right after the `element.animate` block, on the same live `__elProto`
chain link so custom elements inherit it) returns an `ElementInternals` that RETAINS:

- the form value (`setFormValue(value, state)`);
- validity — `setValidity(flags, message)` drives `checkValidity()`/`reportValidity()`/`validity`/
  `validationMessage`/`willValidate`;
- a `states` CustomStateSet (a real Set) that drives `:state(name)` styling;
- ARIA reflection props (`role`, `ariaLabel`, `ariaChecked`, …) and `form`/`labels`/`shadowRoot`.

It enforces once-per-element (a second `attachInternals()` throws `NotSupportedError` via a WeakSet).
We do not yet wire internals into the real form-submission/constraint pipeline — the follow-on — but
retaining the state is what lets the constructor complete, the component upgrade and render, and the
component read its own validity/states back.

### The teeth `G_ELEMENT_INTERNALS` uses

`defined` (internals with the methods + a working `states`), `validity` (clean flags valid; a raised
`valueMissing` with a message invalid with that message), `states` (`add`/`has`), `once` (a second
`attachInternals()` throws). RED: disabling the shim throws `TypeError: … attachInternals is not a
function` and drops `defined`/`validity`/`once`.

## Pointer capture — `setPointerCapture` keeps a drag tracking (tick 319)

Custom sliders, drag-to-reorder lists, canvas drawing, image croppers, color pickers and resizable
panels call `el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)` in their `pointerdown` handler so a drag keeps tracking
after the pointer leaves the element's box. It is used UNGUARDED, so its absence throws
`setPointerCapture is not a function` mid-`pointerdown` and the drag dies on the first press.

### Retain the capture, fire the events; live re-routing is the follow-on

The shim (in `WINDOW_PRELUDE`, on `__elProto` after `attachInternals`) provides `setPointerCapture`,
`releasePointerCapture` and `hasPointerCapture`. It retains the captured pointer id per element (a
WeakMap) so `hasPointerCapture(id)` reflects the truth, and fires `gotpointercapture`/`lostpointercapture`.
The host owns the live pointer-event pipeline, so this cannot yet RE-ROUTE stray moves outside the
element to it — the honest limit — but retaining the capture state and firing the events is what stops
the throw and lets the drag set up and tear down correctly.

### The teeth `G_POINTER_CAPTURE` uses

`defined` (the three methods, no throw), `tracks` (`hasPointerCapture(id)` false → true after
`setPointerCapture` → false after `releasePointerCapture`), `gotevent` (`setPointerCapture` fires
`gotpointercapture`). RED: disabling the shim throws `TypeError: el.hasPointerCapture is not a function`
and drops `defined`/`tracks`.

## `Path2D` — a reusable, declared-once path (incl. SVG path-data strings) (tick 320)

`Path2D` was ABSENT, so `new Path2D(...)` threw `Path2D is not defined` and every icon system
(Lucide/Feather/Material), Chart.js/D3 shape generator and glyph-on-canvas helper died in its
constructor. The engine already accumulates the 2D context's current path as a flat command stream
(`[op, args…]`: `0 moveTo · 1 lineTo · 2 quadTo · 3 cubicTo · 4 close · 5 rect`) and rasterizes it in
ONE native `__cvPath` call, so `Path2D` is that same stream given an object identity.

### Three ways to build one, all producing the same op stream

`new Path2D()` builds imperatively (`moveTo`/`lineTo`/`arc`/`bezierCurveTo`/`quadraticCurveTo`/`rect`/
`ellipse`/`arcTo`/`closePath`, mirroring `ctx`); `new Path2D(other)` copies another path's commands;
`new Path2D("M… L… A… Z")` parses an SVG path-data string — the form icon libraries actually ship.
The parser handles `M L H V C S Q T A Z` in both cases (absolute and relative), implicit command
repetition, and `S`/`T` control-point reflection. `A` (elliptical arc) goes through the SVG spec's
endpoint-to-center conversion (F.6.5) and is flattened to line segments at the same π/8 granularity as
`ctx.arc`, so a real icon's rounded corners render instead of collapsing to a chord.

### The consumer side: `ctx.fill(path)` / `ctx.stroke(path)`

Both now take an optional first argument. It is duck-typed on `__cmds`, so a `Path2D` rasterizes ITS
stream while a bare fill-rule string (`ctx.fill('evenodd')`) still falls through to the context's
current path. `addPath(path, transform?)` appends another path, applying a `DOMMatrix` when given (a
`rect` op under a non-identity transform is expanded to a closed 4-line polygon, since a
rotated/skewed rectangle is no longer axis-aligned). Honest limit: fill-rule (`nonzero`/`evenodd`) is
accepted but not yet distinguished in the rasterizer, matching the existing context behaviour.

### The teeth `G_PATH2D` uses

`type` (`typeof Path2D === 'function'`), `imperative` (a built triangle handed to `ctx.fill(path)`
paints RED pixels inside it), `untouched` (outside the shape stays transparent), `svg`
(`new Path2D("M14 14 h12 v12 h-12 Z")` parses and fills the box it describes), `copy`
(`new Path2D(otherPath)` repaints the same geometry). RED: removing the shim throws `Path2D is not
defined` out of the constructor, the whole script aborts and the output stays `-`.

## `createImageBitmap` — a drawable bitmap from an element/canvas, no new decode path (tick 321)

`createImageBitmap(...)` was ABSENT, so the call threw `createImageBitmap is not a function` and every
texture uploader (Pixi/Three), image editor and tile renderer that does
`createImageBitmap(imgOrCanvas).then(b => ctx.drawImage(b, …))` died. The engine's image-source
registry is keyed by NODE, and both `<img>` (decoded bytes) and `<canvas>` (live backing store) already
publish pixels under their node id — and `ctx.drawImage` already accepts anything carrying `__nodeId`.
So a bitmap of one of those sources is just that node id plus an optional crop rect, with ZERO new
decode FFI.

### What it produces

A global `createImageBitmap` returning a `Promise<ImageBitmap>`, and a named `ImageBitmap` global (so
`instanceof ImageBitmap` resolves; the constructor itself throws `Illegal constructor`, per spec). The
resolved bitmap carries `__nodeId`, real `width`/`height` (read from the source's decoded size via
`__cvSourceSize`), and `close()` (detaches → draws nothing after). The crop overload
`createImageBitmap(source, sx, sy, sw, sh)` stores a crop rect offset into the underlying node's pixels
and composes when the source is itself an already-cropped bitmap. `ctx.drawImage` now reads a source
bitmap's crop: its intrinsic size becomes the crop, and any explicit source rect is shifted into the
crop's origin.

### The honest limit

`Blob` / `ImageData` / SVG-image sources have no `__nodeId` and need a real decode-to-pixels path we do
not have yet, so they REJECT loudly (`InvalidStateError`) rather than resolve to a silently-blank
bitmap — the worse shape of failure. That decode path is the documented follow-on.

### The teeth `G_CREATE_IMAGE_BITMAP` uses

`type`/`ctor` (both globals present), `promise` (resolves for a canvas source), `size` (real 20×20),
`draw`/`drawblue` (blitting the bitmap paints BOTH halves of a left-blue/right-red source), `cropsize`
(the crop overload sizes to 10×20), `cropdraw` (bitmapping the red right-half `(10,0,10,20)` then
blitting at the origin shows RED — proving the crop offset is applied). RED: removing the shim throws
out of the call, the whole script aborts and the output stays `-`.

## Canvas gradients — real linear/radial shaders, not a flat last-stop approximation (tick 322)

A `CanvasGradient` used to be an honest flat approximation: `ctx.fillStyle = grad` painted the whole
shape in the gradient's LAST stop's colour ("a bar drawn in the end colour beats a bar not drawn"). That
is the worst shape of "working" — a chart's area fill, a button's gloss, a progress bar all render as a
solid block, no error. Now `createLinearGradient`/`createRadialGradient` rasterize a REAL tiny-skia
gradient shader.

### The split, following the canvas division of labour

The gradient object stays in JS (`makeGrad` in `engine/js/src/event_loop.rs`): it carries its geometry
(`__geo = [x0,y0,r0, x1,y1,r1]`, `__kind` 0 linear / 1 radial) and `[offset, r, g, b, a]` stops. When
`fillStyle`/`strokeStyle` is a real gradient (`isGrad`: ≥2 stops, not conic), `fill()`, `fillRect()`,
`stroke()`, `strokeRect()` flatten it to a spec `[kind, x0,y0,r0, x1,y1,r1, off,r,g,b,a, …]` and cross
into Rust through the new `__cvPathGradient` native. `globalAlpha` folds into each stop's alpha there,
matching how it modulates a flat fill.

### The Rust side (`canvas.rs`), and the transform subtlety

`gradient_shader` builds a `tiny_skia::LinearGradient` or `RadialGradient` (the two-point-conical form,
mapping canvas's inner circle `(x0,y0,r0)` → outer `(x1,y1,r1)` exactly), with `SpreadMode::Pad` — the
CSS/canvas default that clamps past the ends. The shader is built at **identity transform**, not the
context matrix: tiny-skia's painter applies the fill transform to the shader (`paint.shader.transform`)
as well as the path, so giving it `m` here would transform it twice. Building at identity and filling
with `m` keeps the gradient locked to the user-space geometry under `translate`/`scale`/`rotate`.

### The honest limits

Conic gradients keep the flat last-stop fallback (this tiny-skia build's `SweepGradient` is not wired),
flagged `__conic` so `isGrad` excludes them. `createPattern` still returns `null`. A single-stop or
empty gradient also falls back to a flat colour, exactly as a real 2D context degrades.

### The teeth `G_CANVAS_GRADIENT` uses

`lin_red`/`lin_blue`/`lin_varies` (a red→blue linear fill reads RED at the left, BLUE at the right, and
red falls while blue rises across — a real ramp, where a flat fill would be blue everywhere),
`path_grad` (a gradient fills a `Path` via `ctx.fill`, not only `fillRect`), `rad_center_green`/
`rad_edge_red` (a radial gradient is green at its centre and red past its radius — proving it is radial
and centred where asked). RED: forcing `isGrad` false falls back to the flat last stop and drops
`lin_red`/`lin_varies`/`path_grad`/`rad_center_green` at once.

## Canvas patterns — `createPattern` tiles a source image across the fill (tick 323)

`ctx.createPattern` returned `null` for its whole life, so `fillStyle = ctx.createPattern(img,
'repeat')` set the fill to `null` (→ black) and every hatch fill, textured background and repeating
sprite painted a black block. Now it returns a real `CanvasPattern` that tiles the source.

### Reusing the drawImage registry — no new decode

A pattern is identified by NODE, the same handle `drawImage` uses: `createPattern` (in
`engine/js/src/event_loop.rs`) returns `{ __pattern, __nodeId, __rep }` for any source with published
pixels (an `<img>` or `<canvas>`), or `null` if the source has not decoded yet. When `fillStyle`/
`strokeStyle` is a pattern (`isPat`), `fill()`, `fillRect()`, `stroke()`, `strokeRect()` cross into Rust
via the new `__cvPathPattern` native. `canvas.rs::path_pattern` reads the source pixmap out of the same
`CANVASES`/`SOURCES` registries `draw_image` reads and builds a `tiny_skia::Pattern` shader — the exact
shader `drawImage` already uses, so there is no new pixel path.

### Repetition and the transform

`repeat` maps 0 `repeat` / 1 `repeat-x` / 2 `repeat-y` / 3 `no-repeat`. The pattern is built at identity
and `fill_path` applies the context transform to both path and shader, so the tiling is anchored in
user space at the image's natural size. `globalAlpha` folds into the shader's opacity.

### Honest limits

tiny-skia's `SpreadMode` is not per-axis, so `repeat-x`/`repeat-y` both tile (using `Repeat`) and
`no-repeat` uses `Pad` — its edges clamp rather than going transparent. `pattern.setTransform(matrix)`
is not wired. These are the documented follow-ons; the common `'repeat'` tiling case is exact.

### The teeth `G_CANVAS_PATTERN` uses

`type` (createPattern returns an object, not null), `t0`/`t1` (a red/blue 4px source fills its RED and
BLUE halves — a null pattern fills black, the exact old-stub symptom), `rep`/`rep2` (a full
source-width further along, red then blue RECUR — proving the source repeats, not stretched or drawn
once). RED: forcing `createPattern` back to `null` fills black and drops every claim
(`type:null t0:0,0,0,255`).

## Canvas conic gradients — `createConicGradient` sweeps colour by angle (tick 324)

Conic gradients used to fall back to a flat last-stop fill — there was no sweep shader, so a pie/donut
fill, colour wheel or angular progress ring painted a solid block. tiny-skia 0.12's `SweepGradient`
supplies the missing piece, and the gradient object built in tick 322 already carries everything needed.

### One branch in the existing plumbing

`createConicGradient(startAngle, cx, cy)` now builds a `kind: 2` gradient with the centre in the
`(x0,y0)` slot and the start angle in the `r0` slot (`makeGrad(2, x, y, startAngle, x, y, 0)`).
`gradient_shader` (in `canvas.rs`) adds a `kind == 2` arm that constructs a
`tiny_skia::SweepGradient::new(centre, startDeg, startDeg + 360, stops, Pad, identity)`. The spec's
start angle is radians clockwise from the +x axis; skia's is degrees, same origin and direction, so the
radians→degrees conversion is the entire mapping — confirmed by the gate, whose red stop lands at +x.
`fill`/`fillRect`/`stroke`/`strokeRect` route conic gradients through the same `__cvPathGradient` native
as linear/radial (they are `isGrad` now that the `__conic` flat-fallback flag is gone). A single-stop or
empty conic still degrades to a flat colour via `color()`, as a real context does.

This completes the canvas gradient family: **linear, radial and conic are all real shaders.**

### The teeth `G_CANVAS_CONIC` uses

`right_red` (offset 0 lands at +x — the start-angle placement, where a flat fallback would paint the
LAST stop), `left_mix` (a half-turn away the sweep has reached ~offset 0.5 and carries blue — colour
changes with angle), `sweep_tb` (top and bottom, same radius and opposite angles, differ in blue — a
radial would be identical there and a horizontal linear would match top-to-bottom; only a sweep varies
this way). RED: excluding `kind == 2` from `isGrad` drops back to the flat last stop and fails
`right_red`/`left_mix`/`sweep_tb` at once.

## A11y widget roles — the agent can name the controls web apps build (tick 325)

Modern web apps do not use native `<select>`/`<input>` for their richest controls — they build them out
of `<div role="tab">`, `<div role="switch">`, `<div role="slider">`, `role="menu"`/`menuitem`,
`role="dialog"`. The accessibility tree's `Role` enum stopped at ~26 roles, so every one of those
collapsed to `Generic`. The observation an agent read was an anonymous box (`generic "Dark mode"`) — it
could click it but could not *ground* it: could not answer "is this a switch, and is it on?" even though
`state_of` already computed `checked`/`selected`/`value` from the `aria-*` attributes. The role was the
missing hook.

### Additive role plumbing, no new state path

`Role` gains ~22 ARIA widget roles: the interactive ones — `switch`, `slider`, `spinbutton`, `tab`,
`menuitem`, `option`, `treeitem` — plus their containers — `menu`, `menubar`, `tablist`, `tabpanel`,
`listbox`, `toolbar`, `tree`, `group`, `radiogroup`, `dialog`, `alertdialog`, `tooltip`, `alert`,
`status`, `progressbar`. `from_aria_token` maps each token (with `menuitemcheckbox`/`menuitemradio` →
`menuitem`), `as_str` renders it back, `is_interactive` marks the actionable ones, and
`name_from_content` lets a `tab`/`menuitem`/`option`/`switch`/`treeitem`/`tooltip` take its name from its
subtree text. `role_of` also fills in the HTML-AAM implicit roles for the native widgets: `<dialog>` →
`dialog`, `<progress>` → `progressbar`, `<input type=range>` → `slider`, `<input type=number>` →
`spinbutton`, `<option>` → `option`, `<menu>` → `list`.

The interaction state needed no new code: `state_of` reads `aria-checked`/`aria-selected`/`aria-valuenow`
irrespective of role (it discards the role argument), so a `role="switch" aria-checked="true"` already
reported `[checked]` and a `role="slider" aria-valuenow="42"` already reported `[value="42"]` — they were
only missing a role to hang on. This is why the change is a role table extension, not a state rewrite.

### The teeth `G_A11Y_ROLES` uses

A `role="tablist"` of two tabs (one `aria-selected`, one not), a `role="switch"` that is on, a
`role="slider"` with a value, a `role="menu"` with an enabled and a disabled `menuitem`, a `role="dialog"`,
and the native `<progress>`/`<input type=range>`/`<input type=number>` — each asserted to surface with its
role token and, where applicable, its state (`tab … [selected]`, `switch … [checked]`,
`slider … [value="42"]`, disabled `menuitem`, `progressbar … [value="0.7"]`, `spinbutton … [value="3"]`).
RED: stashing the `Role` table extension renders every one as `generic "…"` (verified — `generic "Dark
mode" [checked]` for the switch), so the widget lines vanish.

## Re-pin (tick 326): four "partial" cells were stale — the capability shipped, the record lagged

A capability lands as a gated tick, but the constellation cell that *names* the capability is edited by
hand and drifts. Four cells still read `partial` with notes that a later tick had already falsified.
This tick re-probed each against its live gate (all green on a warm box, 2026-07-21) and corrected the
record — no engine change, an instrument-fidelity tick, one of the ratchet's three faces.

- **file upload** (`partial -` → `gated G_FILE_INPUT`). The note said "input[file] unmeasured". It is
  measured: `g_file_input` asserts `input.files` length/names/**bytes**, `files===null` on a non-file
  control (pages branch on that to tell a text field from a file field), and that the **multipart body
  carries the file contents** — not the deliberately-useless `C:\fakepath\…` string.
- **`<dialog>` + popover** (`partial -` → `gated G_DIALOG+G_POPOVER`). The note said "popover still
  missing". Popover shipped: `g_popover` covers detect / reflect (`auto|manual|null`) / `showPopover` /
  `beforetoggle`+`toggle`, and `g_popover_render` paints it; `g_dialog` covers `showModal`.
- **hover/dblclick/contextmenu** (`partial G_HOVER` → `gated G_HOVER+G_MOUSE_ACTUATION`). The note said
  "dblclick/contextmenu still absent". `g_mouse_actuation` asserts the full double-click **sequence**
  (`click`,`click`,`dblclick` with detail 1/2/2, the `dblclick` reachable **without** a dblclick
  listener) and a cancelable `contextmenu` via `dispatch_contextmenu`.
- **native `<select>`** (`partial -` → `gated G_SELECT_ACTUATION`). The note said "synthetic
  option-choice + change firing unbuilt". `g_select_actuation` asserts value/`selectedIndex` reads, the
  implicit-first-selection rule, and actuation: `select_option` fires `input` **then** `change` (the
  order React's `onChange` depends on).

**drag-and-drop was left `partial` on purpose** — its note honestly scopes the gap (the file-drop half
is gated via `G_DROP_UPLOAD`; the editor half — `dragstart`/`setData`/`effectAllowed`/drag images for
list-reordering — is genuinely unbuilt). A re-pin sweep that flips *everything* is how a stale record
becomes a lying one; each flip here is backed by a gate that documents its own way to go red.

## Selection API — a real, persistent, directional `window.getSelection()` (tick 328)

`window.getSelection()` was a stub that returned a **fresh inert object on every call**: `rangeCount`
0 forever, every mutator a no-op, `getSelection() !== getSelection()`. It passed a "does the method
exist" check and failed every "did the method do anything" one. The canonical victim is a *copy-this-
code-block* button — `sel.selectAllChildren(pre); clipboard.writeText(sel.toString())` — where
`toString()` answered `''`, so the button copied nothing and threw nothing.

### Backed by the real Range, not a second model

The Selection is now a **single persistent object per window** (`globalThis.__selection`), built in an
IIFE in `event_loop.rs` alongside the `getSelection` install, and `document.getSelection()` returns the
same object. It holds one live `Range` (`range_js.rs` is real), so the whole programmatic surface —
`selectAllChildren` / `addRange` / `getRangeAt` / `collapse` / `collapseToStart|End` / `extend` /
`setBaseAndExtent` / `removeAllRanges` / `deleteFromDocument` / `toString` and the derived getters
`anchorNode` / `anchorOffset` / `focusNode` / `focusOffset` / `rangeCount` / `isCollapsed` / `type` —
is delegation to that Range plus a direction bit. `Selection` is a real constructor (removed from the
inert-names list so it is not shadowed, the AbortSignal lesson), so `x instanceof Selection` is true.

### Direction is the one thing a Range wrapper gets wrong

A `Range` is normalised (`start <= end`); a `Selection` is directional — the **anchor** is the fixed
end and the **focus** is the one `extend()` moves, and a user can drag left. `__set(anchor, focus)`
decides order with a collapsed probe range's `comparePoint`, stores a `_dir` of `'fwd'`/`'bwd'`, and
maps `anchorNode`/`focusNode` onto the range's start/end accordingly. So `extend()` *before* the anchor
is an honest backwards selection: the anchor stays put, `anchorOffset > focusOffset`, and `toString()`
is still the text between the points — where a naive `setEnd` would silently swap the ends.

### Honest limit

This is the **scripting** surface. The geometry of a **user mouse-drag** selection (hit-testing a
sweep across laid-out glyphs) is a layout concern and is not modelled here — `getSelection()` reflects
what scripts set, which is what editors, share widgets and "copy link/code" buttons drive.

### The teeth `G_SELECTION` uses

`same` (one persistent object, not a fresh stub per call), `inst` (real `Selection` instance),
`copyall` (`selectAllChildren` + `toString` yields the element's text — the load-bearing claim),
`fwd`/`caret`/`fwdextend` (offsets and collapse), `backextend` (anchor fixed while focus moves before
it — the direction property a Range wrapper fails), `added`/`oneonly` (`addRange` adopts a range and a
second is ignored, Chrome's one-range model), `throws` (`getRangeAt(0)` on an empty selection throws
`IndexSizeError`). RED: restoring the fresh-inert stub drops `same`/`copyall`/`fwd`/`backextend`/
`added`/`inst` together while `typeof getSelection === 'function'` stays green.
