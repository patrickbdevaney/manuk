# THE INTERACTION SURFACE — clicks, scroll, focus, and automation

## The engine paints at scroll 0 and never tells anything the viewport moved

**This is the single biggest breadth-per-tick item on the board**, because it is **one missing
primitive, not six missing features.** A live viewport unlocks, all at once:

- lazy-loading images (`loading=lazy`, and every JS lazy-loader)
- list virtualisation (every large feed, table, and infinite scroll)
- `position: sticky` behaviour under scroll
- scroll-linked animation
- `IntersectionObserver`-driven content (which is *most* modern content-loading)

**Ask before re-entering JS.** The overwhelming majority of pages have **no** scroll listener, no
IntersectionObserver and no ResizeObserver. Re-entering JS on every wheel event for those pages is pure
cost — a rect-map rebuild, a JS call, and a timer pump, sixty times a second, to tell a page that is not
listening. `wants_view_events()` asks first.

## A click is a hit-test against the LAID-OUT boxes, not a DOM query

A gate that scored "clickability" by counting `<a href>` elements scored a browser that found **zero
links** as *perfectly clickable*. The hit-test reads the fragment tree; the DOM query does not.

## `window` must be an EventTarget

`window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'))` is how a router tells the app it navigated — and it was a
`TypeError`, with a whole listener registry sitting behind it.
