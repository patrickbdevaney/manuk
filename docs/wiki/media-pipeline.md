## Adaptive streaming never touches `<video src="file.mp4">`

Every site that matters for watching — YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Vimeo — and every player library
(hls.js, dash.js, shaka, video.js) does the same thing instead: construct a `MediaSource`, hand the
element a `blob:` URL for it, wait for `sourceopen`, `addSourceBuffer(mime)`, then `appendBuffer()`
media segments fetched over XHR in a loop clocked by `updateend`.

The consequence for an engine that lacks MSE is worse than "video does not play". Those players run
`new MediaSource()` inside a capability probe at **module-evaluation** time, so a missing name is a
`ReferenceError` that kills the player script before it renders a single control — and takes the
surrounding bundle's evaluation with it. A player that cannot construct its source object cannot
fall back to progressive download either. It just stops.

## The attachment handshake is the ONLY channel from element to MediaSource

`video.src = URL.createObjectURL(mediaSource)` is the single moment the element learns which
`MediaSource` it is playing. There is nothing else — no attribute, no registry lookup by name.

That makes `URL.createObjectURL` load-bearing rather than a convenience: it registers the object
against the returned `blob:` id, and the `src` **setter** must intercept the assignment, resolve the
id back to the object, and flip the source `closed` → `open`. Miss the interception and the object
URL is stored as an ordinary attribute string, the source stays `closed`, `sourceopen` never fires,
and the player waits on that event **forever** — a hang with nothing wrong in the DOM to see. That
is exactly the failure `g_mse`'s `syncopen:` claim is positioned to catch.

Two details that bite:

- **Revocation must not detach.** Players call `URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` immediately after
  assigning `src`. Once attached, the element holds the reference; revoking only removes the id from
  the registry. Tearing the stream down there kills it at the instant it starts.
- **Look the reflected `src` accessor up lazily, on the prototype chain, at call time.** Reflection
  installs `src` on the prototype and the interception is installed per element; resolving it
  eagerly bakes in an install-order assumption that is not ours to rely on.

`srcObject = mediaSource` is the newer form of the same handshake with no object URL in between, and
needs its own interception.

## The decode registry: a `false` is worth more than an unbacked `true`

`MediaSource.isTypeSupported()` answers from `__mseCodecs`, the registry of what something
downstream can **genuinely** decode. It is empty until a real decoder lands, so every answer is
`false` and every player takes its documented fallback path.

This is the opposite of the instinct to stub `true`. A `true` that is not backed by a decoder steers
the player onto the adaptive path, where it appends segments and then polls `buffered` for a range
that can never grow — hanging forever, with the failure surfacing far from its cause. The honest
`false` fails immediately, legibly, and in a branch the player already handles.

The registry is the hand-off seam for the rest of the track: M3 (demux) and M4/M5 (AAC / VP9 decode)
push the types they land, and `isTypeSupported` starts saying yes for exactly what can be played,
with no change to any of the surrounding machinery. `g_mse` asserts the `false` **first** and then
registers a codec and asserts the answer flips — which is what proves the honesty is a seam and not
a hardcoded constant.

## `buffered` is a media timeline, not a byte count

Bytes appended are held in order (that queue is what a demuxer will read), but nothing is demuxed,
so no media timeline exists and `buffered` is honestly empty. Reporting a fabricated range from
byte counts would be the same unbacked-`true` mistake in a different place.

## The append sequence is a task sequence, and that is load-bearing

`updatestart` fires synchronously inside `appendBuffer`; `update` and `updateend` fire on a **later
task** (`setTimeout`, not a microtask). A player that re-enters `appendBuffer` from its own
`updateend` must find `updating` already `false` and the previous task fully unwound — a microtask
would not guarantee that. Getting this wrong makes the steady-state fill loop throw on its second
segment.

The spec's `InvalidStateError` on a re-entrant `appendBuffer` (and on `endOfStream()` while a buffer
is updating) exists so the player can queue instead of corrupting the stream; players branch on that
exact error name.

## An `updateend` handler that appends is re-entered by its own append

Worth stating separately, because it cost a tick. A listener that appends a segment is re-invoked by
the very append it just made — an unbounded append/timer chain that never lets the event loop drain.
The page does not fail; it **hangs**, at full CPU, indistinguishable from a slow build. `g_mse`
therefore drives its sequence from one listener dispatching on a step counter, never from a listener
that registers another listener.

This is a real player's fill-loop shape, so the same hazard exists in page content. Note the engine
consequence: a runaway timer chain in page script currently spins `Page::load` without a bound.

## Gates: flush the record on every push, not at the end

`g_mse` writes its result to the DOM on **every** push. The sequence is asynchronous and only
completes on `sourceended`, so a single end-of-run write means any earlier break — source never
opened, append threw, listener never fired — reports the identical empty `-`, naming no claim and
pointing at no mechanism. Per-push flushing makes the last recorded claim the failure's location.
This was not hypothetical: the first RED probe reported `got: -` and proved nothing until fixed.

## M2: the segment corruption at the fetch boundary (found t227, FIXED t228)

Tick 223 built the pipe a player appends into. What it appends comes from an `XHR`/`fetch` with
`responseType = 'arraybuffer'`, usually over a byte `Range`. That path was measured with a 260-byte
probe segment — a real EBML magic followed by all 256 byte values — and it was **broken**:

```
sent 260 bytes  →  received 407.   magic:false   allbytes:differs@0=194
```

**It is not truncation, and it is not U+FFFD replacement** (which is what the probe was originally
written to catch, and what the codebase's earlier lossy-storage bugs looked like). It is UTF-8
**inflation**. The response body crosses the boundary as a Rust `&str`
(`Page::resolve_fetch(id, status, body: &str, …)`), so every byte above `0x7F` is carried as a
codepoint and re-encoded as two bytes on the way back out: `0xDF` → `0xC3 0x9F`, and the `194` in
`differs@0` is `0xC2`, that lead byte.

**Why it hid.** Every byte below `0x80` survives perfectly. JSON, HTML, SSE, form bodies — everything
the fetch path has been used for so far — round-trips exactly. Only binary is destroyed, and the
first binary consumer is the media track.

**Why it was a hard blocker for M3.** `appendBuffer` accepts the segment (it accepts any bytes), and
the demuxer then rejects a stream that was valid when it left the server. The symptom appears in the
demuxer, so it reads as a codec bug — but no amount of work on symphonia fixes a corrupted input.
Demux could not be started until it was fixed.

**The fix was a transport representation, not a parser.** Carry the body as a **binary string** — one
code unit per byte, `charCode & 0xFF` — which is the convention this codebase already uses on the
WebSocket path, and move the UTF-8 decode into `.text()`/`.json()`, where it belongs. That is
correct rather than merely expedient: a `Response` has one body, and *the page* decides whether it is
text or bytes; deciding for it at the boundary is what caused this. It touches `Page::resolve_fetch`,
the shell's `pump_fetches` and the prelude's body accessors together, which is why it is its own
tick.

**What landed (t228).** The body now crosses on **two channels**: the host's charset-decoded text
for `.text()`/`.json()`, and the raw bytes as a one-code-unit-per-byte binary string for
`.arrayBuffer()`/`.bytes()`/`.body` and an `arraybuffer` XHR. Neither derives from the other without
loss — re-encoding the text inflates, and decoding the bytes as UTF-8 in JS would throw away the
charset sniffing that makes a legacy-encoded page readable. `Page::resolve_fetch_bytes` is the entry
point a host with real wire bytes should use; the old `resolve_fetch(&str)` still means "this body IS
text" and remains exactly correct for that.

**The streaming path was never affected**, and that is the tell: `deliver_chunk` already used
`js_bytes_literal`, the one-char-per-byte convention. The buffered path being the odd one out is
precisely how this survived — the fix reuses that same helper rather than inventing a second
encoding.

### What DOES work, and is now pinned

Byte-range requests are real: the page's `Range: bytes=4-11` reaches the wire, the server's `206`
surfaces instead of being flattened to `200`, and the requested bytes come back. Segmented delivery —
the other half of adaptive streaming — is not the problem.
